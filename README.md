# web-dev


## Installing

Then install dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

&nbsp;

# Running

Start the development server. You now have a Gatsby site pulling content from headless Ghost.

```bash
gatsby develop
```

# Deploying to Github Pages

```bash
npm run deploy
```
&nbsp;

# Optimising

You can disable the default Ghost Handlebars Theme front-end by enabling the `Make this site private` flag within your Ghost settings. This enables password protection in front of the Ghost install and sets `<meta name="robots" content="noindex" />` so your Gatsby front-end becomes the source of truth for SEO.

&nbsp;

# Extra options

```bash
# Run a production build, locally
gatsby build

# Serve a production build, locally
gatsby serve
```

Gatsby `develop` uses the `development` config in `.ghost.json` - while Gatsby `build` uses the `production` config.
