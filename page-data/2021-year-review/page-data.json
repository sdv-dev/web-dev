The\ncore belief that drove us was the conviction that more than 90% of data work can\nbe done using synthetic data instead of real data. Early experiments at MIT\n[https://news.mit.edu/2017/artificial-data-give-same-results-as-real-data-0303] \nhad been promising and we were ready to invest our time and energy into that\npromise.\n\nNow, 3 years later, we are pleased to see that the market demand for synthetic\ndata is increasing. In a 2021 article, Gartner predicted\n[https://blogs.gartner.com/andrew_white/2021/07/24/by-2024-60-of-the-data-used-for-the-development-of-ai-and-analytics-projects-will-be-synthetically-generated/] \nthat 60% of data used for AI & analytics will be synthetic by 2024. \n\nAs time progressed, we used feedback from our users to make numerous\nimprovements to the SDV (see articles Part 1\n[https://sdv.dev/blog/community-feedback-models/] and Part 2\n[https://sdv.dev/blog/community-feedback-workflow/]). In response, we've seen\nincreased usage, validating the market need for synthetic data generation\nsoftware. In this article, we'll describe the SDV growth trends in detail.\n\nPersistent 4x/year growth in downloads\nEvery year we are experiencing a 4x increase in SDV downloads. In 2021, we had\n135,000 downloads of SDV – up from 30,576 in 2020. From the start of 2020 to the\nend of 2021, we have seen 16x total increase in SDV downloads. The figure below\nshows our yearly usage.\n\nDownloads of SDV per year since we open sourced the library in 2018. By\ndownloading the SDV, a user is signaling their need for synthetic data – which\nwe can interpret as a vote from the market.The downloads are coming from all\nover the world. In the map below, we list the top 10 countries.\n\nDownloads of the SDV in 2021, broken down by the top 10 countries. Notice that\nEurope accounts for 50 half the countries.Why are users downloading the SDV? We\nknow that they want to create synthetic data, but they are using the synthetic\ndata to solve a variety of different needs. We will explore this more and share\nit in a future article.\n\nOver a thousand new community members\nAnother measure of our growth – and validation from the market – comes from the\nSDV community we've built on our GitHub [https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV] and \nSlack\n[https://join.slack.com/t/sdv-space/shared_invite/zt-gdsfcb5w-0QQpFMVoyB2Yd6SRiMplcw]\n. In 2021, we welcomed more than 1000 new members to these spaces.\n\nA summary of how the SDV Community grew in 2021. Any user can join the community\nand actively participate through the SDV GitHub and Slack.As this article\n[https://www.bvp.com/atlas/measuring-the-engagement-of-an-open-source-software-community] \npoints out, members contribute in several different ways: Many help increase\nawareness of an open source solution for this enterprise pain point. Meanwhile,\nothers jump in, use it and give feedback actively. In 2021, we doubled the\nnumber of unique users raising issues on our GitHub. Throughout the  year, over\n200 members actively participated in our forums by raising GitHub issues or\ncontributing to discussions on Slack.\n\nEnterprise feedback is particularly useful to us. This type of feedback comes\nfrom users who are solving targeted business problems with the SDV. Direct and\nsuccinct feedback explains what would make the SDV more useful. An example is\nshown below.\n\nFeedback about a missing feature – composite keys – that would make a direct\nimpact on an enterprise use case. We've removed the user's GitHub account name\nfor privacy. In this case, the missing feature did make it into our pre-alpha.\nOur team addresses the user feedback throughout the entire SDV ecosystem. The\necosystem includes not only modeling, but also the ability to compare models\nthrough SDGym [https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDGym] and measure synthetic data\nquality through SDMetrics [https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDMetrics]. In 2021, the\nteam put out 49 releases throughout the SDV ecosystem, doubling our number of\nreleases in 2020.\n\nLooking forward to 2022!\nWe are looking forward to 2022! With so many users giving us feedback, we have a\nlong list of features that we want to incorporate. We can't wait to share with\nour community what everyone is using SDV for, and keep on climbing to our\noriginal goal: 90% of data work accomplished with synthetic data.","html":"<p>We started SDV open source in 2018 at MIT with the goal of creating a powerful, usable, machine learning-based synthetic data generation software system.
