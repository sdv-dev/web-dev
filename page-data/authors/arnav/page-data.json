Arnav is a high\nschool student and aspiring data scientist who spent his summer learning about\nthe SDV and how synthetic data is used to perform ML tasks.\n\nOne potential use for synthetic data is to replace real data in the development\nof new machine learning (ML) models. Imagine a scenario where you need to build\na predictive ML model -- perhaps for a function critical to your business, like\npredicting customer satisfaction or sales success -- with one important\nconsideration: The data is sensitive, so only trusted employees can access it\nwith specific credentials.\n\nAccess to sensitive data may create a barrier for a variety of reasons:\n\n * You might not have ML expertise in your organization, which means you need to\n   use external software or contractors to complete the task. However, you are\n   unable to share the data with them.\n * Your data is available on a secure, cloud-based platform for trusted\n   employees to access remotely. They work on this data using interactive\n   notebooks. Every time they lose their connection – due to WiFi outages, their\n   laptops falling asleep, etc. – they may lose their work or have to reconnect.\n * You have a robust authentication system that your team uses. However, it\n   creates a barrier to entry for rapid, iterative collaboration between\n   members, sharing work and debugging data pipelines. As a result, your\n   collaboration is much slower than it would be if your team could access the\n   data without the need to authenticate.\n\nIn cases like this, synthetic data can be an ideal solution: You can create\nsynthetic data based on the original, sensitive data set, and use it more freely\nduring ML development.\n\nSynthetic data can be useful for ML development. You can use synthetic data to\ndevelop models in a variety of environments, like data science platforms, local\nmachines or 3rd party software. Meanwhile, the real data never leaves your\npremises.One key question will determine if this method succeeds: Is the\nsynthetic data actually useful for your ML task? We performed an experiment to\nfind out.\n\nIn the rest of this article, we'll describe our experimental setup and findings.\n(You can double-check our work in this Colab Notebook\n[https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13-1xy5t7veizWBsb_dDgTRBdhGcCqjCJ?usp=sharing]\n.)\n\nExperimental Setup\nIf an ML model is trained using synthetic data instead of real data, what\nhappens to the model's performance? To answer this question, we identified 3\npublicly available datasets (Income\n[https://www.kaggle.com/mastmustu/income?select=train.csv], Bank\n[https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing] and Airline\n[https://www.kaggle.com/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction?select=train.csv]\n) that are associated with particular ML prediction tasks. The datasets and\ntasks are summarized below.\n\nA description of our datasets. *[Moro et al., 2014] S. Moro, P. Cortez and P.\nRita. A Data-Driven Approach to Predict the Success of Bank Telemarketing.\nDecision Support Systems, Elsevier, 62:22-31, June 2014Our experiment compared\nthe performance of an  ML model trained on the original data, vs. one trained on\nthe synthetic data provided by the SDV.\n\n * Control (Original data): How successfully can we complete the ML prediction\n   task if we use the real data? Because some predictions are harder than\n   others, this control helped us identify the overall difficulty of these\n   specific tasks.\n * Experiment (Synthetic data): How successfully can we complete the ML\n   prediction task if we use synthetic data instead? We used the SDV's CopulaGAN\n   [https://sdv.dev/SDV/user_guides/single_table/copulagan.html] to generate\n   synthetic data from the three original datasets.\n\nIn order to develop and test the ML model, we turned to the SDMetrics library —\nspecifically the ML Efficacy metrics\n[https://sdv.dev/SDV/user_guides/evaluation/single_table_metrics.html#machine-learning-efficacy-metrics]\n, which build an ML model and evaluate its performance. We used the Binary\nDecision Tree Classifier and Binary Logistic Regression models. The overall\nexperimental setup is illustrated below.\n\nThe experimental setup evaluated synthetic data against a test set of original\ndata that we set aside at the start. This allows us to compare the usefulness of\nboth types of data for ML tasks.To obtain reliable findings, we ran 3 iterations\nand averaged the results.\n\nResults\nThe graph below shows how well we are able to perform an ML task using the\noriginal vs the synthetic data.\n\nA comparison of ML accuracy scores obtained using real vs. synthetic data,\nallowing us to assess any loss of accuracy that comes from replacing the\noriginal data with synthetic data.Discussion\n\nThe original data quantifies the general difficulty of the ML task. Looking at\nthese values, we can see that the Income Dataset is the hardest task, as neither\nof our methods were able to get above 90% accuracy using the original data.\n\nComparing the datasets allows us to quantify the suitability of synthetic data\nfor ML development. Our results show a loss of between 1 and 9% of the original\nefficacy value for all comparisons, with a median loss of roughly 2.5%.\n\nIt's important to note that the simplifications we've made for this experiment\nmay be resulting in worse accuracy than we would see in real-world use.\n\n * Applying CopulaGAN out-of-the-box to each dataset is simplistic. In a\n   real-world scenario, the model's parameters would likely be explicitly tuned\n   [https://sdv.dev/SDV/user_guides/single_table/copulagan.html] and constraints\n   [https://sdv.dev/SDV/user_guides/single_table/constraints.html] would be used\n   to improve synthetic data quality.\n * The Decision Tree and Logistic Regression evaluators are relatively\n   simplistic ML classifiers. An ML expert (or ML software) might use more\n   advanced techniques.\n * In our scenario, the 3rd party delivers a fully trained, ready-to-go ML\n   model. Another approach is to ask them to use the synthetic data to deliver\n   an untrained model – so that you can train it yourself on the real dataset.\n   This alternative setup, which should increase the prediction accuracy, will\n   be a topic for a future article.\n\nIn summary, the accuracy loss we observe represents the worst case scenario. In\na production environment, higher-quality ML models and more careful tuning of\nthe SDV will likely minimize performance differences between original and\nsynthetic data.\n\nTakeaways\nIn this article, we quantified the effect of replacing real data with a\nsynthetic data clone for ML development. Our results show a loss of 2.5%\naccuracy when using synthetic data. Considering these results, we assess that it\nis reasonable to explore the use of synthetic data for the purpose of ML\ndevelopment.\n\nIn order to maximize the utility of the synthetic data, we recommend tuning the\nSDV model and using constraints to improve the data quality. In future articles,\nwe'll explore more details about using synthetic data for ML.\n\nAre you using the SDV to solve your ML business needs? Publish your findings on\nthe SDV blog as a guest author!
