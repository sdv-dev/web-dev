We, the creators of MIT's Synthetic Data Vault, warmly welcome you\nto our official blog. Soon we'll be using this space to deep-dive into topics\nrelated to our libraries, and to unpack ideas in the synthetic data space. We're\nlooking forward to exploring this exciting area with you.\n\nBut first, we want to properly introduce our project: The Synthetic Data Vault\n[https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV] (SDV), an open source software ecosystem for\ngenerating synthetic data. In this post, we’ll explain why synthetic data is\nimportant, and tell the story of how we created the vault. We’ll also lay out\nwhat’s in store — and how you can get involved. Let’s get started with a brief\noverview.\n\nSynthetic Data What?\nSynthetic data is a bold new frontier in machine learning. It allows developers\nto share and use data more effectively.\n\nIt may seem counterintuitive, but although billions of gigabytes of data are\nproduced every day, there are still huge gaps in what developers are actually\nable to use. Accessibility concerns, regulatory issues and imbalanced datasets\ncan all keep experts from using data. This impedes progress in finance, health\ncare and other domains.\n\nGood synthetic data can fill these gaps. The SDV uses machine learning to\nanalyze data. Then, it creates fully synthetic datasets that mimic the original.\nAlthough the synthetic data is entirely machine generated, it maintains the\noriginal format and mathematical properties. This makes synthetic data\nversatile. It can completely replace the existing data in a workflow, or it can\nsupplement the data to enhance its utility. Already, our users have successfully\nused the SDV to augment datasets, test applications, remove bias and more.\n\nA History of the SDV\nOur story starts in 2013. In MIT's Laboratory for Information and Decision\nSystems (LIDS), we were working on general data science projects. We had\ndeveloped new techniques, and we were excited to test them on real datasets.\nHowever, as soon as we asked for the data, we hit roadblocks. The process for\ngetting access to data turned out to be much more complex than we anticipated,\nwith many regulations and security red tape. \n\nWe wondered: What if we didn't need the real data in the first place? If we had\nsynthetic data with the same mathematical properties as the original, it would\nbe much easier for everyone to share and use.\n\nIn 2016, we released a paper describing the very first iteration of the SDV\n[https://dai.lids.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SDV.pdf]. It introduced a\nnovel technique for synthesizing multi-table data, and included trials where\ndata scientists successfully used synthetic data instead of real data for\nmachine learning tasks. Related research to come out of the lab included CTGAN\n[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.00503.pdf], a novel approach to generating synthetic\ndata using deep learning.\n\nAfter these successes in the research community, we decided to move beyond\npurely academic solutions. Synthetic data has the potential to solve real-world\nproblems faced by people on all sides of data science: internal developers\nwriting software, external contractors working offshore, 3rd party partners\noffering services and even the end users who create the data. After some pilot\ntesting on enterprise applications, we open sourced our work in 2018, publishing \nsdv on PyPi [https://pypi.org/project/sdv/] for general use. Open sourcing\noffered ample opportunities for collaboration and customization. It allowed\nusers all over the world to test the SDV in enterprise settings, and helped the\nSDV ecosystem evolve into a one-stop shop for synthetic data needs!\n\nUsers all over the world are using our software to create synthetic data. This\nmap shows the total downloads* of CTGAN [https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN] (our\nmost popular synthetic data model) per continent.We listened to feedback and, as\nof today, have made 93 releases (across all our libraries), addressing 504\nissues. We have been thrilled to see a burgeoning community of invested users\nusing the SDV to solve problems. We've seen over 200K user downloads from PyPi,\n400 stars in the SDV GitHub repository [https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV] and 200\ndevelopers in our Slack channel. Our community is global and includes people in\ndiverse roles: academics, data scientists, operations managers, engineers and\nmore. We are continually learning from our community, and we're excited to bring\nnew innovations to you!\n\nJust the Beginning\nSynthetic data has the potential to revolutionize the entire field of data\nscience, allowing us to solve problems that once seemed untouchable. We want the\nSynthetic Data Vault to be the most trusted, transparent and comprehensive\nplatform for synthetic data generation, but we can't do it without our users.\nIt's our ever-growing open source community that allows us to quickly repair\nbugs, triage feature requests and improve to serve a variety of real-world\nneeds.\n\nThat’s where you come in. If you’re already a member of this community, we can’t\nthank you enough. And if you’d like to get involved, see below for ways to get\nstarted. Either way, watch this space for more nuanced discussions about\nsynthetic data. We're excited to share what we've learned from you, and show how\nwe are collectively improving the ecosystem. It’s time to open the vault!\n\nWant more ways to get involved?\n\n * Follow us on Twitter @sdv_dev [https://twitter.com/sdv_dev] for release\n   announcements, blog updates and more\n * Join our Slack\n   [https://join.slack.com/t/sdv-space/shared_invite/zt-gdsfcb5w-0QQpFMVoyB2Yd6SRiMplcw] \n   community to meet other users, discuss synthetic data solutions and suggest\n   topics for the blog\n * Visit & star our GitHub repositories [https://github.com/sdv-dev]\n * If you've successfully used the SDV for your project, share your experience\n   and tag us\n\nFor other inquiries, please contact us at info@sdv.dev.\n\n\n*Total download statistics per continent come from the Linehaul project\n[https://github.com/pypa/linehaul] using BigQuery, and include mirrors.
