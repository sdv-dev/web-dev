One of\nthe biggest strengths of ML is automatic rule detection (also known in ML terms\nas correlations): The algorithms are designed to learn patterns in the data,\neven without additional user input. The result is synthetic data that resembles\nthe original, right down to its mathematical properties!\n\nHowever, in some cases, applying an ML model right out of the box may not\nimmediately achieve the desired result. In this article, we'll explore the\nstrengths of ML models and go through those areas where user input may be\nrequired.\n\nStrengths of ML Models\nThe goal of any ML-based synthetic data generation software is to learn from and\nemulate the input data. To illustrate this, let's pretend you work in the car\ninsurance business, and you're in possession of a real dataset related to\ndrivers and their insurance:\n\nAn example dataset, including license and collision coverage information\nassociated with different drivers.An ML-based system, such as the Synthetic Data Vault\n[https://sdv.dev/blog/intro-to-sdv/] (SDV), will learn patterns from the real\ndata and use it to create new synthetic data. Recall some of the important\npatterns that ML algorithms detect:\n\n * Shapes. The general shape of the data. For example, in the dataset above, 50%\n   of drivers have Collision Coverage and the Annual Premium is uniformly\n   scattered between $3,000 and $9,000.\n * Correlations. The trends within the data. For example, having Collision\n   Coverage -- especially Standard coverage -- means a higher Annual Premium.\n\nThese shapes and correlations will be present in the synthetic data that is\noutputted by the ML model, as shown below.\n\nAn example of a synthetic dataset created by an ML-based algorithm. The\nalgorithm will learn patterns from the real data and emulate them.Perhaps the single biggest strength of an ML algorithm is its ability to learn\nrules by looking for general patterns in the data, using probability and\nstatistics.\n\nWhat ML models do not learn out of the box\nLet's take a closer look at the synthetic car insurance data. You might notice\nthat two of the rows in the synthetic data don't make complete sense. Below,\nwe've highlighted the errors.\n\nThe synthetic car insurance data, with errors highlighted.Do you see what has\ngone wrong? In the first row, the license expired 3 years earlier than it was\nissued. In the last row, a driver without Collision Coverage has a Collision\nPolicy Type. Additionally, the same Customer ID has been repeated in Row 3 and\nRow 4.\n\nThere are three rules that the ML algorithm did not follow:\n\n 1. License Expiration > License Issue Year\n 2. If Has Collision Coverage = NO, then Collision Policy Type must be empty\n 3. All Customer IDs must be unique\n\nWhy does the ML model easily pick up on some rules and not others? To answer\nthis question, we can look closely at the rules themselves. All of the rules\nthat the ML model successfully learned -- including the distribution shapes and\nthe correlations -- were based on general trends. These probabilistic rules \napply to a majority of the relationships within the dataset, but not all of\nthem. Although they have to make sense in aggregate, a few rows may be\nexceptions.\n\nBy contrast, the rules that the ML model failed to learn were stricter. These \ndeterministic rules describe intrinsic laws of nature, time or logic. Each and\nevery row must adhere to them, and they won't change regardless of  how much (or\nhow little) data has been given to the ML model.\n\nTo continue with the driving theme: A probabilistic rule is like a yield sign,\nsignaling a general recommendation that works out differently for each\nindividual situation -- some cars may need to stop, while others just slow down.\nMeanwhile, a deterministic rule is like a stop sign, demanding that every single\ncar must come to a full stop.\n\nA probabilistic rule applies to a majority of rows, but leaves room for\nexceptions. Meanwhile, a deterministic rule applies to every single row.By\ndefault, our ML model assumed that all rules were probabilistic. When this\nhappens, synthetic data still generally follows the desired properties -- for\nexample, License Expiration > License Issue Year -- for most of the rows, but\nnot for every row.\n\nImproving the ML Models using constraints\nJust because the ML model didn't automatically follow a deterministic rule\ndoesn't mean that it can't. It's possible to improve the model so that it\nunderstands this type of rule. As a user working with the SDV, you can input\ndeterministic rules into your model using constraints.\n\nAn ML model built using constraints will accommodate both probabilistic and\ndeterministic rules.\n\nDo you need SDV constraints?\n\nDeterministic rules are often easy to spot in your dataset: They are the rules\nthat every single row must follow in order to be valid, regardless of how much\ndata there is overall.  But even if you identify the right constraints, there\nare some cases where you might not actually want to supply them to the SDV.\n\nBecause the SDV learns probabilistic rules, most of the synthesized data is\ngenerally valid. Having a few errors sprinkled in might actually be beneficial\nif you want your synthetic data to cover some edge cases. For example, if you're\nusing the synthetic data to test insurance claim software, leaving in some weird\ndata points might help you ensure that the software can handle unexpected cases\n-- like the License Expiration accidentally being set too early.\n\nThe figure below shows a few questions you can ask to determine whether adding a\nconstraint is the right approach.\n\nShould you input a rule using constraints? First, determine whether the rule is\ndeterministic, and then take your use case into account.The SDV Constraints\noffering\n\nIf you decide that adding deterministic rules is important for generating your\nsynthetic data, the SDV has many different constraints to choose from! The table\nbelow describes the constraints you would need in order to define the\ndeterministic rules that would best mold your Car Insurance dataset.\n\nThe GreaterThan, ColumnFormula and Unique constraints -- all available in the\nSDV -- set the deterministic rules that ensure your synthetic Car Insurance Data\nis useful and makes sense.The SDV offers many more possible constraints,\nincluding:\n\n * UniqueCombinations\n * Positive and Negative\n * Rounding\n * Between\n * OneHotEncoding\n\nYou can add multiple constraints to the same dataset in order to accommodate all\nthe deterministic rules you need. For more details, read the Constraints User\nGuide [https://sdv.dev/SDV/user_guides/single_table/handling_constraints.html].\n\nTakeaways\nIn this article, we learned that:\n\n * Data is governed by rules. The SDV automatically learns probabilistic rules,\n   which describe overall trends or patterns in the data.\n * However, sometimes the data has deterministic rules, which are always\n   inherent no matter how much or how little data there is. ML-based systems,\n   including the SDV, may not enforce deterministic rules out of the box.\n * Users can input deterministic rules to the SDV using constraints. To figure\n   out whether you should input a constraint, ask yourself whether there are any\n   rules that the data must always follow. There are many constraints to choose\n   from.\n\nIn future articles, we'll dive deeper into this topic. We'll explore the\ntechnical details behind constraints, and how exactly the SDV's ML models are\nable to learn deterministic rules.","html":"<p>In our <a href=\"https://sdv.dev/blog/fake-to-synthetic-ml\">previous article</a>, we explored how machine learning (ML) plays a key role in synthetic data creation.

Real data — which is based on\nobservations of real-world phenomena like weather, movements on a factory floor\nor the activities of a user base — can help us notice trends, increase business\nefficiency and solve problems. \n\nBut data can be helpful even if it isn’t real. This data, sometimes called fake\nor test data, doesn’t come directly from real-world observations, but is instead\nartificially crafted by a human or machine. The latest and most complex\niteration of this data type — what we call synthetic data — builds on previous\nwork done in this space. \n\nIn this article, we'll go through the history of fake data. By the end, you'll\nbe able to answer the following questions:\n\n * What were the original motivations and tools for manually creating data?\n * What differentiates synthetic data from other types of fake data?\n * What role does machine learning play in generating synthetic data?\n\nThe Dawn of Fake Data: Test Data Management\nOne group of people has worked with fake data for a long time: software\nengineers. They need data in order to test the systems they build, and the real\nstuff isn't always usable (for example, due to privacy). \n\nLet's pretend it's the early 2000s, and you're an IT professional working at a\nbank. You're responsible for the software that updates account balances after\neach transaction. You'd like to test this software before putting it into\nproduction. What do you do?\n\nMost likely, you'll come up with a few test scenarios to ensure that your\nfunctionality — updating the balance — can properly handle a variety of inputs.\n\nThis table shows a few scenarios you may use to test your system. In these\nscenarios, you're testing how a monetary transfer of $20 changes the balance in\ndifferent accounts.Notice that in order to create these scenarios, you had to\ngenerate data: various starting balances ($500, $20, $10) as well as a transfer\namount ($20). This is an early version of using fake data in order to test your\nsoftware!\n\nUsing Tools for Manual Creation\n\nNow let's fast forward in time. Over the years, your software has gotten even\nmore complex, and you're constantly adding new functionalities. For example,\nmaybe you start allowing transfers with foreign currency. \n\nYou need to test these functionalities before you roll them out. To save time,\nyou might end up using -- or creating -- a tool that allows you to generate and\nmanage fake data for testing. \n\nThe simplest tool may be a basic permutation, as illustrated below.\n\nA simple manual test data generation tool that uses permutations. The resulting\nscenarios -- with different starting balances, transfer amounts and transfer\ncurrencies -- are outputted as a data table.A more sophisticated tool might\nallow you greater control over the rules the data must follow. It will also\nallow you to create more columns as your functionalities increase. For example,\nmaybe the bank now offers two different account types: Premium and Normal. \n\nNow you need a test data generation tool that can handle all of these variables\nand come out with something like this:\n\nA more sophisticated test data tool will allow you to specify rules manually. It\nwill follow them to generate test data.Many test data management tools use\nsophisticated logic to precisely create these data columns and their values. But\nthe rules they use are manually written, and rely on human intuition and domain\nknowledge. For example:\n\n * Account type = Premium 10% of the time and Normal 90% of the time\n * Starting balance is between $10,000 and $250,000 if Account type = Premium\n   or between -$1,000 and $10,000 if Account type = Normal\n * Transfer amount follows a bell curve with a mean of $7,500 and standard\n   deviation of $1,000\n * Etc.\n\nThere are downsides to this manual approach. It takes time and effort to come up\nwith these rules, to keep track of them, and to update them as your application\nchanges.\n\nAdding Machine Learning\nAdopting machine learning (ML) opens up entirely new avenues in data generation.\nIn the process, it gets rid of some of these downsides.\n\nAt a high level, ML-based software (such as the Synthetic Data Vault\n[https://sdv.dev/blog/intro-to-sdv/]) works in three steps:\n\n 1. The user inputs real data into the ML software\n 2. The ML software automatically learns patterns in the data\n 3. The software outputs data that contains those patterns\n\nLet's go back to our banking example to see how this works. It's now 2021 and\nyou're using the SDV [https://sdv.dev/] to generate your test data. You input\nall the transactions your bank has handled in the last week. \n\nAfter modeling, the SDV outputs entirely new data that looks and behaves like\nthe original. An illustration of this is shown below.\n\nWith ML tools (like the SDV), you input real data into the software. The\nsoftware then learns patterns from the data and outputs data that matches those\npatterns.Notice that the output data contains many of the same properties as the\noriginal. The model learned all of the following information:\n\n * Ranges & Categories. Transfers range from $5K to $10K. Bank accounts can be\n   either premium or normal. Etc.\n * Shapes. 10% of accounts are premium. Transfers follow a bell curve\n   distribution with a mean of $7,500 and a standard deviation of $1,000. Etc.\n * Correlations. Premium bank accounts tend to have higher balances ($10K to\n   $250K) than normal accounts (-$1K to $10K).\n\nIn other words: while the old test data management tools required you to\nmanually come up with rules, ML-based tools learn these rules automatically. \nMoreover, they can learn new information. For example, the ML picked upon a\ncouple of extra correlations:\n\n * Premium accounts are more likely to transfer foreign currency.\n * Normal accounts are more likely to be overdrawn (transfer more than their\n   current balance).\n\nUsing an ML-based data generation tool will help you ensure that your software\nis robust against these typical cases. And while manual data generation tools\ngenerate fake data, ML-based approaches generate what we call synthetic data.\n\nAsk whether you had to input any real data or rules. Based on this, you'll know\nwhether you are dealing with synthetic data or fake data.Benefits of Synthetic\nData\n\nThere are some clear advantages to using synthetic data over fake data,\nespecially in software testing. Below, we've detailed a few.\n\n * Saves time with automation. Because ML automatically learns patterns from the\n   real data, there is no need to spend a lot of time coming up with and\n   inputting rules. ML learns rules that you may even miss.\n * Is usable by non-experts. Realistic fake data can only be generated by domain\n   experts, who know the precise rules governing the dataset. However, anyone\n   can generate synthetic data. All they have to do is input the real data and\n   the ML software takes care of the rest!\n * Increases adaptability. Applications and data will inevitably change over\n   time. It's easy to update synthetic data as this happens, simply by\n   retraining the ML model with newer data.\n\nBenefits of synthetic data expand beyond software testing. The SDV Community is\nusing synthetic data for an ever-increasing variety of tasks, including machine\nlearning development, de-biasing datasets and scenario planning.\n\nKey Takeaways\nIn this article, we surveyed numerous ways of creating and using data  that is\nnot real. In particular, we learned that:\n\n * Creating fake data is not a novel concept. Older generations of tools will\n   output fake data when given an explicit list of rules. This is especially\n   useful for software testing.\n * Adding ML to this process is a newer evolution. Users input real data into\n   the ML model, and it's able to automatically infer the rules.

The SDV was born out\nof academic research at MIT — but in 2018, we open-sourced it, so that people\nall over the world could use it.\n\nSince then, we've been listening carefully to our community's feedback, making\nsure that we address any gaps between theoretical academic research and\npractical use. This article is the second in a multi-part series detailing\nrecent improvements to the SDV that make it work in the real world. Here we'll\ndiscuss how we've amped up the data synthesis workflow. (For our previous\ndiscussion about how we've improved core models, see Part 1\n[http://sdv.dev/blog/community-feedback-models].)\n\nWhat are workflows?\nWe open sourced the SDV not just to let users generate synthetic data, but also\nto allow them use that data to solve real-world problems. Our community taught\nus that actually using the SDV involves a multi-step process — and that\nimproving the system means paying attention to this entire workflow, not just\nthe core machine learning.\n\nAccording to our users, this workflow boils down to a few generalizable steps:\n\n 1. Identifying real datasets that need to be synthesized\n 2. Transforming the datasets into a machine-readable format\n 3. Running the machine learning model\n 4. Synthesizing data according to particular specifications\n 5. Reversing the transformations such that the synthesized data looks like the\n    original\n 6. Evaluating the synthesized data that results\n\nThese steps are illustrated in the diagram below.\n\nThe entire synthetic data workflow involves more than just modeling. Data also\nneeds to be transformed, synthesized, reverse transformed, and evaluated.The key\ninsight from our users was that the application of machine learning models is\nonly one step of a much larger puzzle. When the open source community helped us\nunderstand this, we were able to improve on the SDV software by adding in\ntransformations, synthesizing options, and evaluation tools -- all detailed\nbelow.\n\nTransforming Data\nOne major lesson from our open source community was how messy real-world\ndatasets are compared to those used in academia. Academic datasets often come\npre-sanitized and ready for numerical use. In the real world, however, databases\nare growing and changing constantly, and are often significantly different from\nthe optimal yet theoretical structures used by machine learning researchers.\n\nTwo thorny data types frequently encountered in the real world are datetimes and \nnull values.\n\n * Datetimes can follow many different formats, including YYYY-MM-DD or\n   MM-DD-YY. However, machine learning models accept numerical values only.\n   Usually these are Unix timestamps, defined as the number of seconds that have\n   elapsed since January 1, 1970. By this logic, a date like 2021-01-01 will\n   transform into the number 1609488000.\n * Null values also present a problem for mathematical models when they appear\n   in numerical data. While users can tell models to ignore these values, the\n   presence of a null might actually indicate something important, like a user\n   declining to answer a question. To account for this, the SDV creates a new,\n   binary column to address whether the original value is null.\n\nWhen working with real-world datasets, it's necessary to apply transformations\nbetween real data and machine-readable data. This example transforms datetimes\nand null values.To solve this problem, we introduced a new library called Reversible Data\nTransforms [https://github.com/sdv-dev/RDT] (RDT). The RDT library contains\nnecessary logic for transforming different types of real world data to its\nmachine-ready counterpart — as well as the logic for its reversal, so that a\nsynthetic data user won't know the difference. The RDT is a standalone library\nthat can reach beyond the synthetic data space, helping data scientists and\nacademics across fields to clean their data. Since November 2020, the RDT has\nbeen supported on all major platforms including MacOS, Windows, and Linux.\n\nSynthesizing Data Conditionally\nWhen we first imagined the SDV, we assumed users would simply want to use all\nthe synthetic data generated by the model. However, we soon found that some\nusers have more complex needs, and require more control over the data they\nsynthesize — opening up new possibilities for synthetic data in the process.\n\nFor example, one of our users, an engineer, found a whole new use for SDV. The\nengineer was writing a machine learning classifier on a dataset when they\nnoticed it was unbalanced. Applying any algorithms to this dataset would lead to\nbiased models. The engineer realized that, if used strategically, SDV could\nactually debias the data — if it only generated data with rarer attributes, the\nsynthetic data it created could be combined with the real data to form a fully\nbalanced dataset.\n\nSynthesized data can help remove bias by creating balanced datasets. In this\nexample, synthesizing those rows that only correspond to females creates a\nbalance between males and females.In February of 2021, we added conditional sampling\n[https://sdv.dev/SDV/user_guides/single_table/gaussian_copula.html#conditional-sampling] \nto the SDV to enable this use case. Now, users can specify attributes or values\nthat must be present in the synthesized data. In addition to debiasing datasets,\nusers can use this feature to test hypothetical scenarios.\n\nEvaluating Synthesized Data\nWhen the entire system is working smoothly and outputting synthetic data, users\nstill need to know: Is the data good enough to use? This vital question inspired\nus to add evaluation capabilities to the SDV. In doing so, we faced two key\nchallenges: Defining the metrics, and creating a useful process.\n\nMetrics\n\nNo single metric perfectly captures the different dimensions of synthetic data\nusers may want to evaluate. Some want to preserve a high degree of mathematical\nlikeness, others want to emphasize a particular column for machine learning\npredictions, and still others are more focused on threat models that can\ncompromise privacy. \n\nTo address this, we created a separate library, SDMetrics\n[https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDMetrics], to define evaluation metrics. The\nlibrary now includes a suite of metrics that cover differentiation of synthetic\nand real data, statistical likeness, and privacy.\n\nApplication\n\nRather than apply metrics on an ad-hoc basis, some SDV power users were creating\nmini-workflows to rapidly test out different models, datasets and evaluation\ncriteria in succession. Inspired by their innovation, we created SDGym\n[https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDGym], a system that allows users to input models,\ndatasets and success metrics to build a comprehensive evaluation framework.\n\nThe SDV Software Today\nThe SDV software is continuously evolving based on community feedback. In this\narticle, we discussed improvements to the workflow surrounding synthetic data\ngeneration, including data transformations, sampling methods and evaluation\ntools. Earlier, in Part 1 [https://sdv.dev/blog/community-feedback-models] of\nthis series, we discussed the core synthetic data models themselves. In future\nblog articles, we plan to dig deeper into each of these areas, and to uncover\nnew ones with you.\n\nLike the SDV, this blog is a collaborative effort. Use our Slack\n[https://join.slack.com/t/sdv-space/shared_invite/zt-gdsfcb5w-0QQpFMVoyB2Yd6SRiMplcw] \nto let us know which topics you'd like to hear more about. And as always, use \nGitHub [https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV] to file technical issues with the\nsystem. Working together, we can make SDV the most trusted, transparent and\ncomprehensive platform for synthetic data generation!\n\nFor other inquiries, please contact info@sdv.dev [ info@sdv.dev].","html":"<p>The Synthetic Data Vault (SDV) is a software system that allows users all over the world to input a dataset and generate synthetic data.

(For our previous discussion about how we've improved core models, see <a href=\"http://sdv.dev/blog/community-feedback-models\">Part 1</a>.)</p><h3 id=\"what-are-workflows\">What are workflows?</h3><p>We open sourced the SDV not just to let users generate synthetic data, but also to allow them <em>use</em> that data to solve real-world problems. Our community taught us that actually using the SDV involves a multi-step process — and that improving the system means paying attention to this entire workflow, not just the core machine learning.</p><p>According to our users, this workflow boils down to a few generalizable steps:</p><ol><li>Identifying real datasets that need to be synthesized</li><li>Transforming the datasets into a machine-readable format</li><li>Running the machine learning model</li><li>Synthesizing data according to particular specifications</li><li>Reversing the transformations such that the synthesized data looks like the original</li><li>Evaluating the synthesized data that results</li></ol><p>These steps are illustrated in the diagram below.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://sdv.ghost.io/content/images/2021/05/Community-Feedback--Part-2----1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"An illustration of the synthetic data workflow: Transforming data, modeling, synthesizing, reverse transforming, and evaluating.\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1106\" srcset=\"https://sdv.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/05/Community-Feedback--Part-2----1.png 600w, https://sdv.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/05/Community-Feedback--Part-2----1.png 1000w, https://sdv.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2021/05/Community-Feedback--Part-2----1.png 1600w, https://sdv.ghost.io/content/images/size/w2400/2021/05/Community-Feedback--Part-2----1.png 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>The entire synthetic data workflow involves more than just modeling. Data also needs to be transformed, synthesized, reverse transformed, and evaluated.</figcaption></figure><p>The key insight from our users was that the application of machine learning models is only one step of a much larger puzzle. When the open source community helped us understand this, we were able to improve on the SDV software by adding in transformations, synthesizing options, and evaluation tools -- all detailed below.</p><h3 id=\"transforming-data\">Transforming Data</h3><p>One major lesson from our open source community was how messy real-world datasets are compared to those used in academia. Academic datasets often come pre-sanitized and ready for numerical use. In the real world, however, databases are growing and changing constantly, and are often significantly different from the optimal yet theoretical structures used by machine learning researchers.</p><p>Two thorny data types frequently encountered in the real world are <em>datetimes</em> and <em>null values</em>.</p><ul><li><strong>Datetimes</strong> can follow many different formats, including YYYY-MM-DD or MM-DD-YY. However, machine learning models accept numerical values only. Usually these are Unix timestamps, defined as the number of seconds that have elapsed since January 1, 1970. By this logic, a date like 2021-01-01 will transform into the number 1609488000.</li><li><strong>Null values</strong> also present a problem for mathematical models when they appear in numerical data. While users can tell models to ignore these values, the presence of a null might actually indicate something important, like a user declining to answer a question. To account for this, the SDV creates a new, binary column to address whether the original value is null.</li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://sdv.ghost.io/content/images/2021/05/Community-Feedback--Part-2----2-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Two tables showing data in its original and transformed formats.

This example transforms datetimes and null values.</figcaption></figure><p>To solve this problem, we introduced a new library called <a href=\"https://github.com/sdv-dev/RDT\">Reversible Data Transforms</a> (RDT). The RDT library contains necessary logic for transforming different types of real world data to its machine-ready counterpart — as well as the logic for its reversal, so that a synthetic data user won't know the difference. The RDT is a standalone library that can reach beyond the synthetic data space, helping data scientists and academics across fields to clean their data. Since November 2020, the RDT has been supported on all major platforms including MacOS, Windows, and Linux.</p><h3 id=\"synthesizing-data-conditionally\">Synthesizing Data Conditionally</h3><p>When we first imagined the SDV, we assumed users would simply want to use all the synthetic data generated by the model. However, we soon found that some users have more complex needs, and require more control over the data they synthesize — opening up new possibilities for synthetic data in the process.</p><p>For example, one of our users, an engineer, found a whole new use for SDV. The engineer was writing a machine learning classifier on a dataset when they noticed it was unbalanced. Applying any algorithms to this dataset would lead to biased models. The engineer realized that, if used strategically, SDV could actually debias the data — if it only generated data with rarer attributes, the synthetic data it created could be combined with the real data to form a fully balanced dataset.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://sdv.ghost.io/content/images/2021/05/Community-Feedback--Part-2----3.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Biased data that contains more males, plus synthesized data with only females, combines to form a balanced dataset with both males and females.\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1705\" height=\"960\" srcset=\"https://sdv.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/05/Community-Feedback--Part-2----3.png 600w, https://sdv.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/05/Community-Feedback--Part-2----3.png 1000w, https://sdv.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2021/05/Community-Feedback--Part-2----3.png 1600w, https://sdv.ghost.io/content/images/2021/05/Community-Feedback--Part-2----3.png 1705w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>Synthesized data can help remove bias by creating balanced datasets. In this example, synthesizing those rows that only correspond to females creates a balance between males and females.</figcaption></figure><p>In February of 2021, we added <a href=\"https://sdv.dev/SDV/user_guides/single_table/gaussian_copula.html#conditional-sampling\">conditional sampling</a> to the SDV to enable this use case. Now, users can specify attributes or values that must be present in the synthesized data. In addition to debiasing datasets, users can use this feature to test hypothetical scenarios.</p><h3 id=\"evaluating-synthesized-data\">Evaluating Synthesized Data</h3><p>When the entire system is working smoothly and outputting synthetic data, users still need to know: Is the data good enough to use? This vital question inspired us to add evaluation capabilities to the SDV. In doing so, we faced two key challenges: Defining the metrics, and creating a useful process<strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>Metrics</strong></p><p>No single metric perfectly captures the different dimensions of synthetic data users may want to evaluate. Some want to preserve a high degree of mathematical likeness, others want to emphasize a particular column for machine learning predictions, and still others are more focused on threat models that can compromise privacy. </p><p>To address this, we created a separate library, <a href=\"https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDMetrics\">SDMetrics</a>, to define evaluation metrics. The library now includes a suite of metrics that cover differentiation of synthetic and real data, statistical likeness, and privacy.</p><p><strong>Application</strong></p><p>Rather than apply metrics on an ad-hoc basis, some SDV power users were creating mini-workflows to rapidly test out different models, datasets and evaluation criteria in succession. Inspired by their innovation, we created <a href=\"https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDGym\">SDGym</a>, a system that allows users to input models, datasets and success metrics to build a comprehensive evaluation framework.</p><h3 id=\"the-sdv-software-today\">The SDV Software Today</h3><p>The SDV software is continuously evolving based on community feedback. In this article, we discussed improvements to the workflow surrounding synthetic data generation, including data transformations, sampling methods and evaluation tools. Earlier, in <a href=\"https://sdv.dev/blog/community-feedback-models\">Part 1</a> of this series, we discussed the core synthetic data models themselves. In future blog articles, we plan to dig deeper into each of these areas, and to uncover new ones with you.</p><p>Like the SDV, this blog is a collaborative effort. Use our <a href=\"https://join.slack.com/t/sdv-space/shared_invite/zt-gdsfcb5w-0QQpFMVoyB2Yd6SRiMplcw\">Slack</a> to let us know which topics you'd like to hear more about. And as always, use <a href=\"https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV\">GitHub</a> to file technical issues with the system.

The SDV was\nborn out of academic research at MIT — but in 2018, we open-sourced it, so that\npeople all over the world could use it.\n\nSince then, we've been listening carefully to our community's feedback, making\nsure that we address any gaps between theoretical academic research and\npractical use. This multi-part series details recent improvements we've made so\nthat SDV works in the real world. In this article, we focus on the machine\nlearning-based modeling techniques that form the core of the system, while Part\n2 [https://sdv.dev/blog/community-feedback-workflow/] will cover the surrounding\nworkflow.\n\nWhat's in a model?\nAt its core, the SDV is a set of machine learning models designed to understand\nand mimic real world data. Once the SDV creates a particular model, developers\ncan generate synthetic data by sampling it. For synthetic data to be successful,\nthis generative model must be correct — but through discussions with our open\nsource community, we realized that there is no such thing as a single, winning\napproach that works every time. Each dataset and use case is different.\n\n\nOur solution is to provide choices, giving users all the necessary tools to make\nuseful synthetic data for each new case at hand. Let's dive into three popular\nuses of the SDV where such options are available: Tabular models, sequential\ndata and business logic.\n\nMore Options for Tabular Models\nThe earliest version of SDV was based on a classic statistical method: Gaussian\nCopulas [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_(probability_theory)]. This model\nis transparent by definition. It allows us to understand and exert control over\nformulas in the model, notably the distributions of each variable. This can be\nespecially useful for business applications, where data often follows\npredictable distributions. For example, wind speed is known to follow a Weibull\ndistribution [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power], biological measures\nlike height usually follow normal distributions\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution#Occurrence_and_applications] \nand credit default rates often follow exponential distributions\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution].\n\nMeanwhile, advances in the AI space had also produced a robust, alternative\nmodel for those willing to sacrifice transparency: A deep learning technique\ncalled Generative Adversarial Networks\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network] (GANs). GANs\nmodel complex processes that don't follow known formulas. While these models’\ninner workings aren’t easily explained by humans, they produce highly accurate\nresults. We created a GAN, called CTGAN, specifically for synthetic data. This\nblack box model is especially good at figuring out complex correlations between\nvariables in large datasets.\n\nFor a long time, SDV allowed users a choice between our Gaussian Copulas based\nmodel, called GaussianCopula, and CTGAN to model tabular data. While this choice\nprovided some flexibility, our users reported they had a hard time choosing\nbetween such extreme alternatives. We wondered if a middle ground was possible:\nCould we specify distributions while also using GANs to identify complex\ncorrelations?\n\nWe couldn't find any model that fit both of these requirements, so we made our\nown! A key insight was that we could use Gaussian Copulas to understand the data\nand transform it before applying it to a GAN. The result is CopulaGAN\n[https://sdv.dev/SDV/user_guides/single_table/copulagan.html], a hybrid model we\nreleased in October 2020.\n\nCopulaGAN is in the middle of the spectrum, between simple, easily understood\nmodels (like GaussianCopula) and complex black box models (like CTGAN).CopulaGAN\ncombines the human accessibility of Gaussian Copulas with the robust accuracy of\nGANs. This innovation provides users with a new choice: a hybrid approach.\n\nThe Special Case of Sequential Data\nAnother tricky case pointed out by our users involved sequential data. While\nsequential data is stored in a table, it is unlike a regular table in that its\nrows are linked together, usually by a time component. This use case is\nextremely frequent, especially in finance — any table with credit card\ntransactions, stock prices, or payments is almost certainly sequential. \n\nAt the time, solutions treated sequential data as a case of general tabular\nmodeling. After all, sequential data is inside a table. However, these solutions\nfailed to incorporate the key information that makes sequential data unique: The\nrelationships that exist between rows.\n\nIn this table of stock prices, rows that describe the same company — in this\ncase, Google — are related to each other through time. Related rows are a\nspecial feature of sequential datasets.While considering this pain point, we\nrecognized sequential data as an entirely new case that required its own unique\nset of modeling techniques. In October 2020, we released our DeepEcho library,\nwhich focuses entirely on sequential data. We also introduced our PAR model:\n[https://sdv.dev/SDV/user_guides/timeseries/par.html] a GAN approach made\nspecifically for sequential data.\n\nEncoding Business Logic using Constraints\nEven with a plethora of modeling choices, it's vital to capture nuances in\nbusiness logic while modeling synthetic data. This is due to differences in how\nhumans and machines understand datasets.\n\nOften, humans can easily glean the meaning of a dataset using context clues.\nConsider a table showing the names and ages of students and their legal\nguardians. A human will intuitively realize that a student must be younger than\ntheir guardian.\n\nIn this table of students and their guardians, the student is always younger\nthan their guardian. This is a constraint that humans intuitively understand.But\nwill a machine understand the same rule? Because all of the SDV's models use\nstatistics, they analyze trends generally — meaning that in this case, they will\ninclude a small possibility that a student could be older than their guardian.\nAfter all, is it totally out of the question that an older individual could\nenroll and list their child as their guardian? Either way, only a human expert\ncan truly figure out what makes sense for this dataset!\n\nTo solve this pain point, SDV introduced the concept of constraints\n[https://sdv.dev/SDV/user_guides/single_table/constraints.html] in July 2020.\nConstraints give users the ability to encode their business knowledge and\nexpertise into an SDV model. In our example, they could specify that a\nguardian's age must be greater than the student's. Currently, the GreaterThan\nand UniqueCombination constraints allow for easy handling of common scenarios.\nWe also provide a blanket CustomConstraint class, which gives users flexibility\nto capture more nuanced knowledge.\n\nMore Community Feedback\nWe believe that the more humans and machines can work together, the more\nefficient our processes can become. In this article, we explained how user\nfeedback about the SDV led to new core modeling techniques and innovations —\nenabling a system that now provides a choice of multiple models, handles\nsequential data, and understands constraints. In Part 2\n[https://sdv.dev/blog/community-feedback-workflow/], we will discuss similar\nfeedback-driven innovations in the rest of the workflow.\n\nUsing SDV — and giving us feedback — fuels this rapid evolution. To start a\ndiscussion, please message us on Slack\n[https://join.slack.com/t/sdv-space/shared_invite/zt-gdsfcb5w-0QQpFMVoyB2Yd6SRiMplcw] \nor file an issue on GitHub [https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV].

A human will intuitively realize that a student must be younger than their guardian.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://sdv.ghost.io/content/images/2021/05/Community-Feedback--Part-1----3.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"A table of student names, their ages, their guardians, and the guardians' ages.\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"969\" srcset=\"https://sdv.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/05/Community-Feedback--Part-1----3.png 600w, https://sdv.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/05/Community-Feedback--Part-1----3.png 1000w, https://sdv.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2021/05/Community-Feedback--Part-1----3.png 1600w, https://sdv.ghost.io/content/images/2021/05/Community-Feedback--Part-1----3.png 2230w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>In this table of students and their guardians, the student is always younger than their guardian. This is a constraint that humans intuitively understand.</figcaption></figure><p>But will a machine understand the same rule? Because all of the SDV's models use statistics, they analyze trends generally — meaning that in this case, they will include a small possibility that a student could be older than their guardian. After all, is it totally out of the question that an older individual could enroll and list their child as their guardian? Either way, only a human expert can truly figure out what makes sense for this dataset!</p><p>To solve this pain point, SDV introduced the concept of <a href=\"https://sdv.dev/SDV/user_guides/single_table/constraints.html\">constraints</a> in July 2020. Constraints give users the ability to encode their business knowledge and expertise into an SDV model. In our example, they could specify that a guardian's age must be greater than the student's. Currently, the GreaterThan and UniqueCombination constraints allow for easy handling of common scenarios. We also provide a blanket CustomConstraint class, which gives users flexibility to capture more nuanced knowledge.</p><h3 id=\"more-community-feedback\">More Community Feedback</h3><p>We believe that the more humans and machines can work together, the more efficient our processes can become. In this article, we explained how user feedback about the SDV led to new core modeling techniques and innovations — enabling a system that now provides a choice of multiple models, handles sequential data, and understands constraints. In <a href=\"https://sdv.dev/blog/community-feedback-workflow/\">Part 2</a>, we will discuss similar feedback-driven innovations in the rest of the workflow.</p><p>Using SDV — and giving us feedback — fuels this rapid evolution. To start a discussion, please message us on <a href=\"https://join.slack.com/t/sdv-space/shared_invite/zt-gdsfcb5w-0QQpFMVoyB2Yd6SRiMplcw\">Slack</a> or file an issue on <a href=\"https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV\">GitHub</a>. Working together, we can make SDV the most trusted, transparent and comprehensive platform for synthetic data generation!</p><p><em>For other inquiries, please contact <strong>info@sdv.dev</strong>.</em><br></p>","url":"https://sdv.ghost.io/community-feedback-models/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"b07a410f-1cf1-45f1-a82e-e66cfdaf61b9","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"609c351b88b3f9003e07ffb8","reading_time":5}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"product","pageNumber":0,"humanPageNumber":1,"skip":0,"limit":12,"numberOfPages":1,"previousPagePath":"","nextPagePath":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["2061773391","2358152166","2362887240","2439066133","2561578252","2657115718","2731221146","2839364760","4145280475"]}
