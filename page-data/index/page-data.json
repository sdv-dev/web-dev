To answer this question, we identified 3\npublicly available datasets (Income\n[https://www.kaggle.com/mastmustu/income?select=train.csv], Bank\n[https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing] and Airline\n[https://www.kaggle.com/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction?select=train.csv]\n) that are associated with particular ML prediction tasks. The datasets and\ntasks are summarized below.\n\nA description of our datasets. *[Moro et al., 2014] S. Moro, P. Cortez and P.\nRita. A Data-Driven Approach to Predict the Success of Bank Telemarketing.\nDecision Support Systems, Elsevier, 62:22-31, June 2014Our experiment compared\nthe performance of an  ML model trained on the original data, vs. one trained on\nthe synthetic data provided by the SDV.\n\n * Control (Original data): How successfully can we complete the ML prediction\n   task if we use the real data? Because some predictions are harder than\n   others, this control helped us identify the overall difficulty of these\n   specific tasks.\n * Experiment (Synthetic data): How successfully can we complete the ML\n   prediction task if we use synthetic data instead? We used the SDV's CopulaGAN\n   [https://sdv.dev/SDV/user_guides/single_table/copulagan.html] to generate\n   synthetic data from the three original datasets.\n\nIn order to develop and test the ML model, we turned to the SDMetrics library —\nspecifically the ML Efficacy metrics\n[https://sdv.dev/SDV/user_guides/evaluation/single_table_metrics.html#machine-learning-efficacy-metrics]\n, which build an ML model and evaluate its performance. We used the Binary\nDecision Tree Classifier and Binary Logistic Regression models. The overall\nexperimental setup is illustrated below.\n\nThe experimental setup evaluated synthetic data against a test set of original\ndata that we set aside at the start. This allows us to compare the usefulness of\nboth types of data for ML tasks.To obtain reliable findings, we ran 3 iterations\nand averaged the results.\n\nResults\nThe graph below shows how well we are able to perform an ML task using the\noriginal vs the synthetic data.\n\nA comparison of ML accuracy scores obtained using real vs. synthetic data,\nallowing us to assess any loss of accuracy that comes from replacing the\noriginal data with synthetic data.Discussion\n\nThe original data quantifies the general difficulty of the ML task. Looking at\nthese values, we can see that the Income Dataset is the hardest task, as neither\nof our methods were able to get above 90% accuracy using the original data.\n\nComparing the datasets allows us to quantify the suitability of synthetic data\nfor ML development. Our results show a loss of between 1 and 9% of the original\nefficacy value for all comparisons, with a median loss of roughly 2.5%.\n\nIt's important to note that the simplifications we've made for this experiment\nmay be resulting in worse accuracy than we would see in real-world use.\n\n * Applying CopulaGAN out-of-the-box to each dataset is simplistic. In a\n   real-world scenario, the model's parameters would likely be explicitly tuned\n   [https://sdv.dev/SDV/user_guides/single_table/copulagan.html] and constraints\n   [https://sdv.dev/SDV/user_guides/single_table/constraints.html] would be used\n   to improve synthetic data quality.\n * The Decision Tree and Logistic Regression evaluators are relatively\n   simplistic ML classifiers. An ML expert (or ML software) might use more\n   advanced techniques.\n * In our scenario, the 3rd party delivers a fully trained, ready-to-go ML\n   model.

We've previously explored how the SDV allows user to \ninput their logic [https://sdv.dev/blog/eng-sdv-constraints/] using constraints.\nWith constraints, an SDV model produces logically correct data 100% of the time.\n\nWhile an end user might expect the constraint to \"just work,\" engineering this\nfunctionality requires some creative techniques. In this article, we'll describe\nthe techniques we used to build the UniqueCombinations constraint. You can also\nfollow along in our notebook\n[https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1bY8y6m7-CjTxWDepw32-ZT3Ubb9RGK5F?usp=sharing]\n.\n\n!pip install sdv==0.13.1\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport warnings\n\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\nWhat is a Unique Combinations Constraint?\nUsers frequently encounter logical constraints on the permutations -- mixing &\nmatching -- that are allowed in synthetic data.\n\nTo illustrate this, let's use the world_v1 dataset from the SDV tabular dataset\ndemos. This simple dataset describes the population of different cities around\nthe world.\n\nfrom sdv.demo import load_tabular_demo\n\ndata = load_tabular_demo('world_v1')\ndata = data.drop(['add_numerical'], axis=1) # not needed for this demo\ndata.head()\n\nRelationship between Name, CountryCode and District\n\nLooking at the data, we can observe that there is a special relationship between\nthe Name of the city, its CountryCode and its geographical District: When\ngenerating synthetic data, the model should not blindly mix-and-match these\nvalues. Instead, it should reference the real data to verify whether the\ncombination is valid. This is called a UniqueCombinations constraint.\n\nFor example, take a particular city, like Cambridge, which appears 3 times in\nour dataset.\n\ndata[data.Name == 'Cambridge']\n\nThe constraint states that Cambridge should only ever appear with GBR (England), \nCAN (Ontario) or USA (Massachusetts). It is invalid if it appears in any other\nregion -- for eg. Cambridge, France.\n\nHow does the SDV handle a Unique Combination out-of-the-box?\n\nLet's try running the sdv as-is on the dataset to see what happens. We'll use\nthe GaussianCopula model on our dataset.\n\nfrom sdv.tabular import GaussianCopula\n\nnp.random.seed(0)\n\nmodel = GaussianCopula(\n  categorical_transformer='label_encoding' # optimize speed\n) \nmodel.fit(data)\n\nNow, let's generate some rows to inspect the synthetic data.\n\nnp.random.seed(12)\nmodel.sample(5)\n\nAlthough the sdv is generating known city names, countries and districts, their\ncombinations don't make sense. We can also go back to our original example and\ngenerate only some rows for Cambridge.\n\nnp.random.seed(10)\n\nconditions = {'Name': 'Cambridge'}\nmodel.sample(5, conditions=conditions)\n\nThe result is a variety of Cambridges that aren't necessarily in USA, GBR, or\nCAN. These aren't valid cities!\n\nWhat's going on? The SDV models include probabilities that some unseen\ncombinations are possible. This is by design: Synthesizing new combinations --\nthat don't blatantly match the original data -- helps with privacy.\n\nHowever in this particular case, we aren't worried about the privacy of a city\nbelonging to a country or district. We actually do want the data to match. This\nis why we need to build a constraint.\n\nFixing the data using rejecting sampling\nIn our previous article [https://sdv.dev/blog/eng-sdv-constraints/], we\ndescribed a solution called reject_sampling that works on any type of constraint\nand is very easy to build: We simply create the synthetic data as usual and then\nthrow out (reject) any data that doesn't match.\n\nIn theory, this can solve our UniqueCombinations constraint. In practice, this\nstrategy is only efficient if the model can easily generate acceptable data.\nLet's calculate the chances of getting an acceptable combination (Name, \nCountryCode, District) from the model.\n\nnp.random.seed(0)\n\n# Sample data from the model\n# The sample may include combinations that aren't valid\nn = 100000\nnew_data = model.sample(n)\n\n# Calculate how many rows are valid\ncombo = ['Name', 'CountryCode', 'District']\nmerged = new_data.merge(data, left_on=combo, right_on=combo, how='left')\npassed = merged[merged['ID_y'].notna()].shape[0]\n\n# Print out our results\nprint(\"Valid rows: \", (passed/n)*100, \"%\")\nprint(\"Rejected rows: \", (1 - passed/n)*100, \"%\")\n\nValid rows:  0.038 %\nRejected rows:  99.96199999999999 %\n\nWith such a low probability of passing the constraint, this strategy can become\nintractable.\n\nFixing the data using transformations\nA more efficient strategy is for the ML model to learn the constraint directly,\nso it always produces acceptable data. We can do this by transforming the data\nin a clever way, forcing the model to learn the logic.\n\nOur previous article [https://sdv.dev/blog/eng-sdv-constraints/] described how\nto do this for a different constraint. Unfortunately, the exact same\ntransformation won't work to solve our current UniqueCombinations constraint. \nThe transform strategy requires a different, creative solution for each\nconstraint. So we have to start from scratch.\n\nCan you think of any other ways to enforce UniqueCombinations?\n\nA solution: Concatenating the data\n\nOne solution is to concatenate the data. That is, rather than treating the city \nName, CountryCode and District as separate items, we treat them as a single\nvalue. This will force the model to learn them as 1 single concept rather than\nas multiple columns that can be recombined.\n\nLet's see this in action.\n\n# create transformed data that concatenates the columns\ndata_transform = data.copy()\n\n# Concatenate the data using a separator\ndata_transform['concatenated'] = data_transform['Name'] + '#' + data_transform['CountryCode'] + '#' + data_transform['District']\n\n# We can drop the individual columns\ndata_transform.drop(labels=['Name', 'CountryCode', 'District'],\n                    axis=1, inplace=True)\n\ndata_transform.head()\n\nNow, we can train the model using the transformed (concatenated) data instead.\n\nnp.random.seed(35)\n\n# create a new model that will learn from the transformed data\nmodel_transform = GaussianCopula(categorical_transformer='label_encoding')\nmodel_transform.fit(data_transform)\n\n# this will produce transformed data\noutput = model_transform.sample()\noutput.head(5)\n\nTo get back realistic-looking data, we can convert the concatenated column back\ninto Name, City and District.\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Split the conatenated column by the separator and save the reuslts\nnames = []\ncountrycodes = []\ndistricts = []\n\nfor x in output['concatenated']:\n  try:\n    name, countrycode, district = x.split('#')\n  except:\n    name, countrycode, district = [np.nan]*3\n  names.append(name)\n  countrycodes.append(countrycode)\n  districts.append(district)\n\n# Add the individual columns back in\noutput['Name'] = pd.Series(names)\noutput['CountryCode'] = pd.Series(countrycodes)\noutput['District'] = pd.Series(districts)\n\n# Drop the concatenated column\noutput.drop(labels=['concatenated'], axis=1, inplace=True)\n\nAs a result, the output now looks like our original data.\n\noutput.head()\n\nMost importantly, the Name, CountryCode and District columns now make sense!\n\nCaveats of transforming the data\n\nThe transform strategy is an efficient and elegant approach to modeling. But\nthere is a downside: The transform strategy might lose some mathematical\nproperties.\n\nTo see why, consider the model's perspective:\n\n * Cambridge#GBR#England is completely different from\n * Cambridge#USA#Massachusetts is completely different from\n * Boston#USA#Massachusetts\n\nThe problem is that two of these actually have something in common -- they are\nlocated in Massachusetts, USA. So the model will not be able to learn anything\nspecial about Massachusetts or USA as a whole.\n\nAs an example, let's see how well the model was able to learn populations of\nUS-based cities.\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Populations of real US cities\nreal_usa = data.loc[data['CountryCode'] == 'USA', 'Population']\n\n# Populations of synthetic US cities\nsynth_usa = output.loc[output['CountryCode'] == 'USA', 'Population']\n\n# Plot the distributions\nplt.ylabel('US City Data')\nplt.xlabel('Population')\n_ = plt.boxplot([real_usa, synth_usa],\n                showfliers=False,\n                labels=['Real', 'Synthetic'],\n                vert=False\n)\nplt.show()\n\nThe real data shows less variation in city population than the synthetic data.\nThe differences make sense because our model wasn't able to learn about the USA\nas one complete concept.\n\nCan we fix this? It's challenging to fix this issue without degrading the\nmathematical correlations in some other way. If you have any ideas, we welcome\nyou to join our discussion [https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/414]!\n\nInputting a UniqueCombination into the SDV\nWe built the constraint -- both the reject_sampling and transform approaches --\ndirectly into the SDV library. If you have sdv installed, this is ready to use.\nImport the UniqueCombinations class from the constraints module.\n\nfrom sdv.constraints import UniqueCombinations\n\n# Create a Unique Combinations constraint\nunique_city_country_district = UniqueCombinations(\n  columns=['Name', 'CountryCode', 'District'],\n  handling_strategy='transform' # you can change this 'reject_sampling' too\n)\n\n# Create a new model using the constraint\nupdated_model = GaussianCopula(\n  constraints=[unique_city_country_district],\n  categorical_transformer='label_encoding'\n)\n\nNow, you can train the model on your data and sample synthetic data.\n\nnp.random.seed(35)\n\nupdated_model.fit(data)\nupdated_model.sample(5)\n\nAll of the synthetic data is guaranteed to follow the UniqueCombinations \nconstraint.\n\nTakeaways\n 1. We can identify a UniqueCombinations requirement by asking: Should it be\n    possible to further mix-and-match the data?\n 2. We can enforce any logical constraint by using reject sampling, which throws\n    out any invalid data. This is not efficient for UniqueCombinations.\n 3. An alternative approach is to transform the data, forcing the ML model to\n    learn the constraint. For UniqueCombinations we transformed the data by\n    concatenating it.\n 4. The logic for UniqueCombinations is already built into the SDV's constraints \n    module, and is ready to use.\n\nFurther reading:\n\n * Engineering Constraints Blog Article\n   [https://sdv.dev/blog/eng-sdv-constraints/]\n * Handling Constraints User Guide\n   [https://sdv.dev/SDV/user_guides/single_table/constraints.html]\n * Tabular Constraints API\n   [https://sdv.dev/SDV/api_reference/constraints/tabular.html]","html":"<p>By default, a machine learning model (ML) may not always learn the deterministic rules in your dataset.

While these\nmodels are powerful, they may not learn everything. In our previous article\n[https://sdv.dev/blog/user-input-synthetic-data/], we described how the SDV\nmodels may not learn deterministic rules. These are patterns and laws that are\ninherent to the dataset:\n\n * They are unchangeable, no matter what data you input.\n * They describe rules that must apply to every row, no exceptions.\n\nLuckily, it's possible for you to improve the machine learning model: When you\ninput constraints, it ensures the model will learn deterministic rules and\nultimately improve the quality of your synthetic data.\n\nIn this article, we'll dive into the technical details of how you can apply\nconstraints and how they work under-the-hood. You can also follow along in our \nnotebook\n[https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cVGv2Xtzhd9qHgbkjsYLeLzsA8bDd1uA?usp=sharing]\n.\n\n!pip install sdv==0.13.0\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport warnings\n\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\nThe Dataset\nThe dataset we're using comes from a Kaggle Competition\n[https://www.kaggle.com/c/expedia-hotel-recommendations/data?select=train.csv] \nhosted by Expedia. We've modified the data slightly for our use.\n\nfrom sdv.demo import load_tabular_demo\n\ndata = load_tabular_demo('expedia_hotel_logs')\n\nIn this real-world dataset, each row represents a search result for a hotel\nbooking.\n\nFor the purposes of this notebook, we'll drop some columns that aren't useful to\nus.\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Drop some columns that aren't useful for this demo\ndrop_columns = ['date_time', 'user_location_country', 'user_location_region',\n                'user_location_city', 'user_id', 'srch_destination_id',\n                'hotel_country', 'hotel_market', 'hotel_cluster',\n                'srch_destination_type_id', 'orig_destination_distance',\n                'posa_continent', 'site_name', 'channel']\ndata = data.drop(drop_columns, axis=1)\n\n# make sure these columns are read as datetimes\nfor col in ['srch_ci', 'srch_co']:\n  data[col] = pd.to_datetime(data[col])\n\n# Inspect the data\ndata.head()\n\nThe search parameters, for finding a hotel room, saved in this dataset come from\nfrom user's input. For example:\n\nDeterministic Rule\n\nIn order for the search to be valid, the searched check-in date must happen\nbefore the searched check-out date. That is: srch_ci < srch_co.\n\nThis is an inherent property of any search, not just for this particular dataset\n-- we call this a deterministic rule. We can verify if this is true by checking\nfor any exceptions.\n\nprint('Violations of the deterministic rule')\nlen(data[data['srch_ci'] > data['srch_co']])\n\n0\n\nWill SDV's machine learning model learn this out of the box?\n\nTo test this, let's use SDV to learn a GaussianCopula model from the data and\nsample synthetic data.\n\nfrom sdv.tabular import GaussianCopula\n\nnp.random.seed(0)\n\nmodel = GaussianCopula(primary_key='log_id')\nmodel.fit(data)\n\nsynth_data = model.sample(500)\nsynth_data.head()\n\nNow, we can inspect the synthetic data to see if there are any invalid rows.\n\ninvalid_row_indices = synth_data['srch_ci'] > synth_data['srch_co']\ninvalid_rows = synth_data[invalid_row_indices]\n\nnum_invalid = len(invalid_rows)\nperc_invalid = num_invalid / len(synth_data) * 100\nprint('Number of invalid rows:', num_invalid, '(', round(perc_invalid, 2), '%)')\n\ninvalid_rows.head()\n\nThe majority of the rows (94.8%) are valid, meaning the model learned the rule\npretty accurately. It learned probabilistically that if the srch_ci is higher \nsrch_co should be even higher. However, some invalid rows (~5%) are still\ncreated so the model did not learn this deterministic rule.\n\nThis raises the question: What can we do to enforce a deterministic rule?\n\nImproving the synthetic data\nLet's explore some options for enforcing our deterministic rule in order to\nimprove the overall quality of the synthetic data.\n\nRejecting invalid data\n\nThe simplest solution is to simply drop the invalid rows, and continually sample\nfrom the model until the desired amount of valid rows are produced. We call this \nreject sampling.\n\nThe code below performs reject sampling until we have synthesized 500 rows.\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Keep track of how many valid rows we've sampled\nnum_valid_rows = synth_data.shape[0] - invalid_rows.shape[0]\n\nwhile num_valid_rows < 500:\n  # Reject the invalid data \n  synth_data = synth_data.drop(invalid_rows.index)\n  \n  # Create new data to replace the invalid data\n  new_data = model.sample(500-num_valid_rows)\n  synth_data = pd.concat([synth_data, new_data])\n  invalid_rows = synth_data[synth_data['srch_ci'] > synth_data['srch_co']]\n  num_valid_rows = synth_data.shape[0] - invalid_rows.shape[0]\n\nsynth_data.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)\n\nNow, there are no invalid rows in our dataset.\n\ninvalid_rows = synth_data[synth_data['srch_ci'] > synth_data['srch_co']]\ninvalid_rows.shape[0]\n\n0\n\nIn this example, we got lucky. Only a small percentage of the rows were invalid\neach time sample was called.\n\nWhat would happen if majority of the rows were invalid every time we sampled? It\nwould take a longer time to get all the desired rows. Sampling time is the\nprimary drawback of reject sampling. Is there another approach we can use to\nimprove the time?\n\nTransforming your data\n\nInstead of reject sampling, what if the model never produced invalid rows in the\nfirst place? To achieve this, we can alter the input data to the model so it's\nforced to learn the constraint.\n\nLet's stop giving the srch_ci and srch_co to the model. Instead, let's teach the\nmodel to learn the srch_ci and the difference between the dates.\n\ndifference = srch_co - srch_ci\n\nThe model will produce srch_ci and difference as a result. Then, we can\nre-compute srch_co with the opposite formula.\n\nsrch_co = srch_ci + difference\n\n(Of course, we need to make sure the difference is always positive, which we can\ndo using a log + 1.)\n\nLet's see this in action.\n\n# Compute the difference\ndiff = (data['srch_co'] - data['srch_ci']).astype('timedelta64[D]')\n\n# Take the log and add one to ensure that it's positive\ndate_diff = np.log(diff + 1)\n\n# The model should learn this column instead of the checkout date\nmodified_data = data.drop('srch_co', axis=1)\nmodified_data['difference'] = date_diff\nmodified_data[['srch_ci', 'difference']].head()\n\nNow, we can fit the model with the modified data. The new samples will include\nthe srch_ci and date_diff columns.\n\nnp.random.seed(20)\n\nmodified_model = GaussianCopula(primary_key='log_id')\nmodified_model.fit(modified_data)\n\nmodified_synth_data = modified_model.sample(500)\nmodified_synth_data[['srch_ci', 'difference']].head()\n\nWe can recompute the srch_co based on srch_ci and difference.\n\n# Undo the log+1 that we added\ndiff = (np.exp(modified_synth_data['difference'].values).round() - 1).clip(0).astype('timedelta64[ns]')\n\n# Reconstruct the end_date and remove the date_diff column\nmodified_synth_data['srch_co'] = modified_synth_data['srch_ci'] + diff\nmodified_synth_data = modified_synth_data.drop('difference', axis=1)\n\nmodified_synth_data.head()\n\nLet's verify that this computation does not create any invalid rows.\n\ninvalid_rows = modified_synth_data[modified_synth_data['srch_ci'] > modified_synth_data['srch_co']]\ninvalid_rows.shape[0]\n\n0\n\nThe transformation worked! In our case, this was a more efficient way to enforce\nthe deterministic rule.\n\nBut if our rule were more complex -- and we couldn't think of a transformation\n-- we could always fall back to reject sampling.\n\nInputting deterministic rules in the SDV\nWe've seen how reject sampling and transform can be used to improve the quality\nof the synthetic data by accounting for deterministic rules. However, it may be\ncumbersome for you to manually implement these strategies. In fact, we saw some\ncommon problems in our SDV user community:\n\n * Users had multiple deterministic rules in their dataset. For example, there\n   could be multiple comparisons between different pairs of columns.\n * Users from multiple domains often had the same kind of deterministic rule.\n   For example, one column being greater than another is a common deterministic\n   rule, agonistic of a use case or domain.\n\nTo solve these problems, we introduced a constraints module in the SDV. With the\nconstraints module, SDV users can easily input deterministic rules. Let's look\nat an example.\n\nUsing the SDV constraints module\n\nThe constraints module in the SDV contains several different types of\npre-defined deterministic rules.\n\nWe will use the GreaterThan constraint, which will enforce that one column's\nvalues are always greater than another's.\n\nfrom sdv.constraints import GreaterThan\n\nNext, we can input the logic of our deterministic rule by creating a constraint\nobject. The GreaterThan constraint accepts the column names as input.\n\ngt_constraint = GreaterThan(\n  low='srch_ci',\n  high='srch_co')\n\nFinally, we can input this constraint when instantiating the model.\n\nnp.random.seed(10)\n\n# Apply the constraint to the model\nmodel_with_constraint = GaussianCopula(\n  primary_key='log_id',\n  constraints=[gt_constraint])\n\nmodel_with_constraint.fit(data)\n\n# Sample synthetic data\nconstrained_data = model_with_constraint.sample(500)\nconstrained_data.head()\n\nAs a result, we should see that all 500 generated rows are valid on the first\ntry. No invalid rows are present in our dataset.\n\ninvalid_rows = constrained_data[constrained_data['srch_ci'] > constrained_data['srch_co']]\ninvalid_rows.shape[0]\n\n0\n\nUsing the SDV was much simpler than writing the code ourselves! Plus, we can\ncreate multiple constraints for the same dataset an easily use them on other\ndatasets.\n\nSpecifying the strategy in the constraints module\n\nBy default, the GreaterThan constraint uses the transform strategy. However, you\ncan use the handling_strategy argument to control this. This argument accepts \n'reject_sampling' or 'transform' as valid strategies.\n\ngt_reject_constraint = GreaterThan(\n  low='srch_ci',\n  high='srch_co',\n  handling_strategy='reject_sampling' # specify the strategy\n)\n\nSimilar to before, we can then input this constraint into the model.\n\nnp.random.seed(30)\n\n# Apply the constraint to the model\nmodel_with_reject_constraint = GaussianCopula(\n  primary_key='log_id',\n  constraints=[gt_reject_constraint])\n\nmodel_with_reject_constraint.fit(data)\n\n# Sample synthetic data\nconstrained_reject_data = model_with_reject_constraint.sample(500)\nconstrained_reject_data.head()\n\ninvalid_rows = constrained_reject_data[constrained_reject_data['srch_ci'] > constrained_reject_data['srch_co']\ninvalid_rows.shape[0]\n\n0\n\nWhat other deterministic rules are already available in SDV?\nThe GreaterThan constraint is one kind of deterministic rule, but there may be\nothers that apply to your dataset. The SDV offers more constraints for other\ntypes of logic.\n\n * Unique\n   [https://sdv.dev/SDV/user_guides/single_table/handling_constraints.html#unique-constraint] \n   when values in a column must be unique to the entire dataset.\n * UniqueCombinations\n   [https://sdv.dev/SDV/user_guides/single_table/handling_constraints.html#uniquecombinations-constraint] \n   to limit the permutations between multiple columns.\n * Positive and Negative\n   [https://sdv.dev/SDV/user_guides/single_table/handling_constraints.html#positive-and-negative-constraints] \n   to enforce boundaries.\n * ColumnFormula\n   [https://sdv.dev/SDV/user_guides/single_table/handling_constraints.html#columnformula-constraint] \n   when there is a formulaic association between columns.\n * Rounding\n   [https://sdv.dev/SDV/user_guides/single_table/handling_constraints.html#rounding-constraint] \n   to enforce decimal precision.\n * Between\n   [https://sdv.dev/SDV/user_guides/single_table/handling_constraints.html#between-constraint] \n   when one column's values must be between 2 other values.\n * OneHotEncoding\n   [https://sdv.dev/SDV/user_guides/single_table/handling_constraints.html#onehotencoding-constraint] \n   when your data includes a variable with one hot encoding.\n\nFor each of them, you can specify handling strategies for reject_sampling to\ndiscard invalid data or transform to modify the data (unique to each\nconstraint).\n\nWhat if my rule isn't included in the module?\n\nYou may come across a rule that cannot be described by any of the constraints\nclasses in the SDV. In this case, you can define a CustomConstraint\n[https://sdv.dev/SDV/user_guides/single_table/custom_constraints.html#defining-custom-constraints] \nwith logic specific to your use case.\n\nAdditionally, consider filing a feature request on GitHub\n[https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/new/choose] with details about your use\ncase & scenario. We can add your logic as a pre-defined constraint so others can\nbenefit from it too!\n\nTakeaways\nIn this notebook, we explored what happens when we have a deterministic rule in\nour dataset.\n\n 1. Machine learning models may not able to learn the deterministic rules out of\n    the box, but it is possible to improve the model to learn these types of\n    rules.\n 2. Deterministic rules can be handled by discarding invalid data (reject\n    sampling) or by adding some clever preprocessing to your code (transforming\n    ).\n 3. The SDV offers a constraints module that allows you to input commonly found\n    deterministic rules. You can specify the handling strategy for each\n    constraint and apply multiple rules to the same dataset.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nFor further information about constraints refer to the Handling Constraints\nUser\nGuide [https://sdv.dev/SDV/user_guides/single_table/handling_constraints.html].","html":"<p>The SDV uses machine learning (ML) to automatically learn rules (aka correlations) from real data and generate accurate synthetic data.

One of\nthe biggest strengths of ML is automatic rule detection (also known in ML terms\nas correlations): The algorithms are designed to learn patterns in the data,\neven without additional user input. The result is synthetic data that resembles\nthe original, right down to its mathematical properties!\n\nHowever, in some cases, applying an ML model right out of the box may not\nimmediately achieve the desired result. In this article, we'll explore the\nstrengths of ML models and go through those areas where user input may be\nrequired.\n\nStrengths of ML Models\nThe goal of any ML-based synthetic data generation software is to learn from and\nemulate the input data. To illustrate this, let's pretend you work in the car\ninsurance business, and you're in possession of a real dataset related to\ndrivers and their insurance:\n\nAn example dataset, including license and collision coverage information\nassociated with different drivers.An ML-based system, such as the Synthetic Data Vault\n[https://sdv.dev/blog/intro-to-sdv/] (SDV), will learn patterns from the real\ndata and use it to create new synthetic data. Recall some of the important\npatterns that ML algorithms detect:\n\n * Shapes. The general shape of the data. For example, in the dataset above, 50%\n   of drivers have Collision Coverage and the Annual Premium is uniformly\n   scattered between $3,000 and $9,000.\n * Correlations. The trends within the data. For example, having Collision\n   Coverage -- especially Standard coverage -- means a higher Annual Premium.\n\nThese shapes and correlations will be present in the synthetic data that is\noutputted by the ML model, as shown below.\n\nAn example of a synthetic dataset created by an ML-based algorithm. The\nalgorithm will learn patterns from the real data and emulate them.Perhaps the single biggest strength of an ML algorithm is its ability to learn\nrules by looking for general patterns in the data, using probability and\nstatistics.\n\nWhat ML models do not learn out of the box\nLet's take a closer look at the synthetic car insurance data. You might notice\nthat two of the rows in the synthetic data don't make complete sense. Below,\nwe've highlighted the errors.\n\nThe synthetic car insurance data, with errors highlighted.Do you see what has\ngone wrong? In the first row, the license expired 3 years earlier than it was\nissued. In the last row, a driver without Collision Coverage has a Collision\nPolicy Type. Additionally, the same Customer ID has been repeated in Row 3 and\nRow 4.\n\nThere are three rules that the ML algorithm did not follow:\n\n 1. License Expiration > License Issue Year\n 2. If Has Collision Coverage = NO, then Collision Policy Type must be empty\n 3. All Customer IDs must be unique\n\nWhy does the ML model easily pick up on some rules and not others? To answer\nthis question, we can look closely at the rules themselves. All of the rules\nthat the ML model successfully learned -- including the distribution shapes and\nthe correlations -- were based on general trends. These probabilistic rules \napply to a majority of the relationships within the dataset, but not all of\nthem. Although they have to make sense in aggregate, a few rows may be\nexceptions.\n\nBy contrast, the rules that the ML model failed to learn were stricter. These \ndeterministic rules describe intrinsic laws of nature, time or logic. Each and\nevery row must adhere to them, and they won't change regardless of  how much (or\nhow little) data has been given to the ML model.\n\nTo continue with the driving theme: A probabilistic rule is like a yield sign,\nsignaling a general recommendation that works out differently for each\nindividual situation -- some cars may need to stop, while others just slow down.\nMeanwhile, a deterministic rule is like a stop sign, demanding that every single\ncar must come to a full stop.\n\nA probabilistic rule applies to a majority of rows, but leaves room for\nexceptions. Meanwhile, a deterministic rule applies to every single row.By\ndefault, our ML model assumed that all rules were probabilistic. When this\nhappens, synthetic data still generally follows the desired properties -- for\nexample, License Expiration > License Issue Year -- for most of the rows, but\nnot for every row.\n\nImproving the ML Models using constraints\nJust because the ML model didn't automatically follow a deterministic rule\ndoesn't mean that it can't. It's possible to improve the model so that it\nunderstands this type of rule. As a user working with the SDV, you can input\ndeterministic rules into your model using constraints.\n\nAn ML model built using constraints will accommodate both probabilistic and\ndeterministic rules.\n\nDo you need SDV constraints?\n\nDeterministic rules are often easy to spot in your dataset: They are the rules\nthat every single row must follow in order to be valid, regardless of how much\ndata there is overall.  But even if you identify the right constraints, there\nare some cases where you might not actually want to supply them to the SDV.\n\nBecause the SDV learns probabilistic rules, most of the synthesized data is\ngenerally valid. Having a few errors sprinkled in might actually be beneficial\nif you want your synthetic data to cover some edge cases. For example, if you're\nusing the synthetic data to test insurance claim software, leaving in some weird\ndata points might help you ensure that the software can handle unexpected cases\n-- like the License Expiration accidentally being set too early.\n\nThe figure below shows a few questions you can ask to determine whether adding a\nconstraint is the right approach.\n\nShould you input a rule using constraints? First, determine whether the rule is\ndeterministic, and then take your use case into account.The SDV Constraints\noffering\n\nIf you decide that adding deterministic rules is important for generating your\nsynthetic data, the SDV has many different constraints to choose from! The table\nbelow describes the constraints you would need in order to define the\ndeterministic rules that would best mold your Car Insurance dataset.\n\nThe GreaterThan, ColumnFormula and Unique constraints -- all available in the\nSDV -- set the deterministic rules that ensure your synthetic Car Insurance Data\nis useful and makes sense.The SDV offers many more possible constraints,\nincluding:\n\n * UniqueCombinations\n * Positive and Negative\n * Rounding\n * Between\n * OneHotEncoding\n\nYou can add multiple constraints to the same dataset in order to accommodate all\nthe deterministic rules you need. For more details, read the Constraints User\nGuide [https://sdv.dev/SDV/user_guides/single_table/handling_constraints.html].\n\nTakeaways\nIn this article, we learned that:\n\n * Data is governed by rules. The SDV automatically learns probabilistic rules,\n   which describe overall trends or patterns in the data.\n * However, sometimes the data has deterministic rules, which are always\n   inherent no matter how much or how little data there is. ML-based systems,\n   including the SDV, may not enforce deterministic rules out of the box.\n * Users can input deterministic rules to the SDV using constraints. To figure\n   out whether you should input a constraint, ask yourself whether there are any\n   rules that the data must always follow. There are many constraints to choose\n   from.\n\nIn future articles, we'll dive deeper into this topic. We'll explore the\ntechnical details behind constraints, and how exactly the SDV's ML models are\nable to learn deterministic rules.","html":"<p>In our <a href=\"https://sdv.dev/blog/fake-to-synthetic-ml\">previous article</a>, we explored how machine learning (ML) plays a key role in synthetic data creation.

To answer this question, we can look closely at the rules themselves. All of the rules that the ML model successfully learned -- including the distribution shapes and the correlations -- were based on general trends. These <strong>probabilistic rules</strong> apply to a majority of the relationships within the dataset, but not all of them. Although they have to make sense in aggregate, a few rows may be exceptions.</p><p>By contrast, the rules that the ML model failed to learn were stricter. These <strong>deterministic rules</strong> describe intrinsic laws of nature, time or logic. Each and every row must adhere to them, and they won't change regardless of  how much (or how little) data has been given to the ML model.</p><p>To continue with the driving theme: A probabilistic rule is like a yield sign, signaling a general recommendation that works out differently for each individual situation -- some cars may need to stop, while others just slow down. Meanwhile, a deterministic rule is like a stop sign, demanding that every single car must come to a full stop.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://sdv.ghost.io/content/images/2021/11/Figure-06.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"A probabilistic rule applies to a majority of rows, but leaves room for exceptions.

It's possible to improve the model so that it understands this type of rule. As a user working with the SDV, you can input deterministic rules into your model using <strong>constraints</strong>.</p><p>An ML model built using constraints will accommodate both probabilistic and deterministic rules.</p><p><strong>Do you need SDV constraints?</strong></p><p>Deterministic rules are often easy to spot in your dataset: They are the rules that every single row must follow in order to be valid, regardless of how much data there is overall.  But even if you identify the right constraints, there are some cases where you might not actually want to supply them to the SDV.</p><p>Because the SDV learns probabilistic rules, most of the synthesized data is generally valid. Having a few errors sprinkled in might actually be beneficial if you want your synthetic data to cover some edge cases. For example, if you're using the synthetic data to test insurance claim software, leaving in some weird data points might help you ensure that the software can handle unexpected cases -- like the License Expiration accidentally being set too early.</p><p>The figure below shows a few questions you can ask to determine whether adding a constraint is the right approach.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://sdv.ghost.io/content/images/2021/12/Figure-07.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Should you input a rule using constraints?

Real data — which is based on\nobservations of real-world phenomena like weather, movements on a factory floor\nor the activities of a user base — can help us notice trends, increase business\nefficiency and solve problems. \n\nBut data can be helpful even if it isn’t real. This data, sometimes called fake\nor test data, doesn’t come directly from real-world observations, but is instead\nartificially crafted by a human or machine. The latest and most complex\niteration of this data type — what we call synthetic data — builds on previous\nwork done in this space. \n\nIn this article, we'll go through the history of fake data. By the end, you'll\nbe able to answer the following questions:\n\n * What were the original motivations and tools for manually creating data?\n * What differentiates synthetic data from other types of fake data?\n * What role does machine learning play in generating synthetic data?\n\nThe Dawn of Fake Data: Test Data Management\nOne group of people has worked with fake data for a long time: software\nengineers. They need data in order to test the systems they build, and the real\nstuff isn't always usable (for example, due to privacy). \n\nLet's pretend it's the early 2000s, and you're an IT professional working at a\nbank. You're responsible for the software that updates account balances after\neach transaction. You'd like to test this software before putting it into\nproduction. What do you do?\n\nMost likely, you'll come up with a few test scenarios to ensure that your\nfunctionality — updating the balance — can properly handle a variety of inputs.\n\nThis table shows a few scenarios you may use to test your system. In these\nscenarios, you're testing how a monetary transfer of $20 changes the balance in\ndifferent accounts.Notice that in order to create these scenarios, you had to\ngenerate data: various starting balances ($500, $20, $10) as well as a transfer\namount ($20). This is an early version of using fake data in order to test your\nsoftware!\n\nUsing Tools for Manual Creation\n\nNow let's fast forward in time. Over the years, your software has gotten even\nmore complex, and you're constantly adding new functionalities. For example,\nmaybe you start allowing transfers with foreign currency. \n\nYou need to test these functionalities before you roll them out. To save time,\nyou might end up using -- or creating -- a tool that allows you to generate and\nmanage fake data for testing. \n\nThe simplest tool may be a basic permutation, as illustrated below.\n\nA simple manual test data generation tool that uses permutations. The resulting\nscenarios -- with different starting balances, transfer amounts and transfer\ncurrencies -- are outputted as a data table.A more sophisticated tool might\nallow you greater control over the rules the data must follow. It will also\nallow you to create more columns as your functionalities increase. For example,\nmaybe the bank now offers two different account types: Premium and Normal. \n\nNow you need a test data generation tool that can handle all of these variables\nand come out with something like this:\n\nA more sophisticated test data tool will allow you to specify rules manually. It\nwill follow them to generate test data.Many test data management tools use\nsophisticated logic to precisely create these data columns and their values. But\nthe rules they use are manually written, and rely on human intuition and domain\nknowledge. For example:\n\n * Account type = Premium 10% of the time and Normal 90% of the time\n * Starting balance is between $10,000 and $250,000 if Account type = Premium\n   or between -$1,000 and $10,000 if Account type = Normal\n * Transfer amount follows a bell curve with a mean of $7,500 and standard\n   deviation of $1,000\n * Etc.\n\nThere are downsides to this manual approach. It takes time and effort to come up\nwith these rules, to keep track of them, and to update them as your application\nchanges.\n\nAdding Machine Learning\nAdopting machine learning (ML) opens up entirely new avenues in data generation.\nIn the process, it gets rid of some of these downsides.\n\nAt a high level, ML-based software (such as the Synthetic Data Vault\n[https://sdv.dev/blog/intro-to-sdv/]) works in three steps:\n\n 1. The user inputs real data into the ML software\n 2. The ML software automatically learns patterns in the data\n 3. The software outputs data that contains those patterns\n\nLet's go back to our banking example to see how this works. It's now 2021 and\nyou're using the SDV [https://sdv.dev/] to generate your test data. You input\nall the transactions your bank has handled in the last week. \n\nAfter modeling, the SDV outputs entirely new data that looks and behaves like\nthe original. An illustration of this is shown below.\n\nWith ML tools (like the SDV), you input real data into the software. The\nsoftware then learns patterns from the data and outputs data that matches those\npatterns.Notice that the output data contains many of the same properties as the\noriginal. The model learned all of the following information:\n\n * Ranges & Categories. Transfers range from $5K to $10K. Bank accounts can be\n   either premium or normal. Etc.\n * Shapes. 10% of accounts are premium. Transfers follow a bell curve\n   distribution with a mean of $7,500 and a standard deviation of $1,000. Etc.\n * Correlations. Premium bank accounts tend to have higher balances ($10K to\n   $250K) than normal accounts (-$1K to $10K).\n\nIn other words: while the old test data management tools required you to\nmanually come up with rules, ML-based tools learn these rules automatically. \nMoreover, they can learn new information. For example, the ML picked upon a\ncouple of extra correlations:\n\n * Premium accounts are more likely to transfer foreign currency.\n * Normal accounts are more likely to be overdrawn (transfer more than their\n   current balance).\n\nUsing an ML-based data generation tool will help you ensure that your software\nis robust against these typical cases. And while manual data generation tools\ngenerate fake data, ML-based approaches generate what we call synthetic data.\n\nAsk whether you had to input any real data or rules. Based on this, you'll know\nwhether you are dealing with synthetic data or fake data.Benefits of Synthetic\nData\n\nThere are some clear advantages to using synthetic data over fake data,\nespecially in software testing. Below, we've detailed a few.\n\n * Saves time with automation. Because ML automatically learns patterns from the\n   real data, there is no need to spend a lot of time coming up with and\n   inputting rules. ML learns rules that you may even miss.\n * Is usable by non-experts. Realistic fake data can only be generated by domain\n   experts, who know the precise rules governing the dataset. However, anyone\n   can generate synthetic data. All they have to do is input the real data and\n   the ML software takes care of the rest!\n * Increases adaptability. Applications and data will inevitably change over\n   time. It's easy to update synthetic data as this happens, simply by\n   retraining the ML model with newer data.\n\nBenefits of synthetic data expand beyond software testing. The SDV Community is\nusing synthetic data for an ever-increasing variety of tasks, including machine\nlearning development, de-biasing datasets and scenario planning.\n\nKey Takeaways\nIn this article, we surveyed numerous ways of creating and using data  that is\nnot real. In particular, we learned that:\n\n * Creating fake data is not a novel concept. Older generations of tools will\n   output fake data when given an explicit list of rules. This is especially\n   useful for software testing.\n * Adding ML to this process is a newer evolution. Users input real data into\n   the ML model, and it's able to automatically infer the rules. Data generated\n   using ML-based systems is known as synthetic data.\n * Synthetic data's key advantages include its automation and adaptability. The\n   uses of synthetic data expand beyond software testing.\n\nIn future articles, we'll put ML models to the test! We'll uncover their\nstrengths and weaknesses, and guide you through getting the most from synthetic\ndata using the Synthetic Data Vault.","html":"<p>Data is a great source of information.

The SDV was born out\nof academic research at MIT — but in 2018, we open-sourced it, so that people\nall over the world could use it.\n\nSince then, we've been listening carefully to our community's feedback, making\nsure that we address any gaps between theoretical academic research and\npractical use. This article is the second in a multi-part series detailing\nrecent improvements to the SDV that make it work in the real world. Here we'll\ndiscuss how we've amped up the data synthesis workflow. (For our previous\ndiscussion about how we've improved core models, see Part 1\n[http://sdv.dev/blog/community-feedback-models].)\n\nWhat are workflows?\nWe open sourced the SDV not just to let users generate synthetic data, but also\nto allow them use that data to solve real-world problems. Our community taught\nus that actually using the SDV involves a multi-step process — and that\nimproving the system means paying attention to this entire workflow, not just\nthe core machine learning.\n\nAccording to our users, this workflow boils down to a few generalizable steps:\n\n 1. Identifying real datasets that need to be synthesized\n 2. Transforming the datasets into a machine-readable format\n 3. Running the machine learning model\n 4. Synthesizing data according to particular specifications\n 5. Reversing the transformations such that the synthesized data looks like the\n    original\n 6. Evaluating the synthesized data that results\n\nThese steps are illustrated in the diagram below.\n\nThe entire synthetic data workflow involves more than just modeling. Data also\nneeds to be transformed, synthesized, reverse transformed, and evaluated.The key\ninsight from our users was that the application of machine learning models is\nonly one step of a much larger puzzle. When the open source community helped us\nunderstand this, we were able to improve on the SDV software by adding in\ntransformations, synthesizing options, and evaluation tools -- all detailed\nbelow.\n\nTransforming Data\nOne major lesson from our open source community was how messy real-world\ndatasets are compared to those used in academia. Academic datasets often come\npre-sanitized and ready for numerical use. In the real world, however, databases\nare growing and changing constantly, and are often significantly different from\nthe optimal yet theoretical structures used by machine learning researchers.\n\nTwo thorny data types frequently encountered in the real world are datetimes and \nnull values.\n\n * Datetimes can follow many different formats, including YYYY-MM-DD or\n   MM-DD-YY. However, machine learning models accept numerical values only.\n   Usually these are Unix timestamps, defined as the number of seconds that have\n   elapsed since January 1, 1970. By this logic, a date like 2021-01-01 will\n   transform into the number 1609488000.\n * Null values also present a problem for mathematical models when they appear\n   in numerical data. While users can tell models to ignore these values, the\n   presence of a null might actually indicate something important, like a user\n   declining to answer a question. To account for this, the SDV creates a new,\n   binary column to address whether the original value is null.\n\nWhen working with real-world datasets, it's necessary to apply transformations\nbetween real data and machine-readable data. This example transforms datetimes\nand null values.To solve this problem, we introduced a new library called Reversible Data\nTransforms [https://github.com/sdv-dev/RDT] (RDT). The RDT library contains\nnecessary logic for transforming different types of real world data to its\nmachine-ready counterpart — as well as the logic for its reversal, so that a\nsynthetic data user won't know the difference. The RDT is a standalone library\nthat can reach beyond the synthetic data space, helping data scientists and\nacademics across fields to clean their data. Since November 2020, the RDT has\nbeen supported on all major platforms including MacOS, Windows, and Linux.\n\nSynthesizing Data Conditionally\nWhen we first imagined the SDV, we assumed users would simply want to use all\nthe synthetic data generated by the model. However, we soon found that some\nusers have more complex needs, and require more control over the data they\nsynthesize — opening up new possibilities for synthetic data in the process.\n\nFor example, one of our users, an engineer, found a whole new use for SDV. The\nengineer was writing a machine learning classifier on a dataset when they\nnoticed it was unbalanced. Applying any algorithms to this dataset would lead to\nbiased models. The engineer realized that, if used strategically, SDV could\nactually debias the data — if it only generated data with rarer attributes, the\nsynthetic data it created could be combined with the real data to form a fully\nbalanced dataset.\n\nSynthesized data can help remove bias by creating balanced datasets. In this\nexample, synthesizing those rows that only correspond to females creates a\nbalance between males and females.In February of 2021, we added conditional sampling\n[https://sdv.dev/SDV/user_guides/single_table/gaussian_copula.html#conditional-sampling] \nto the SDV to enable this use case. Now, users can specify attributes or values\nthat must be present in the synthesized data. In addition to debiasing datasets,\nusers can use this feature to test hypothetical scenarios.\n\nEvaluating Synthesized Data\nWhen the entire system is working smoothly and outputting synthetic data, users\nstill need to know: Is the data good enough to use? This vital question inspired\nus to add evaluation capabilities to the SDV. In doing so, we faced two key\nchallenges: Defining the metrics, and creating a useful process.\n\nMetrics\n\nNo single metric perfectly captures the different dimensions of synthetic data\nusers may want to evaluate. Some want to preserve a high degree of mathematical\nlikeness, others want to emphasize a particular column for machine learning\npredictions, and still others are more focused on threat models that can\ncompromise privacy. \n\nTo address this, we created a separate library, SDMetrics\n[https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDMetrics], to define evaluation metrics. The\nlibrary now includes a suite of metrics that cover differentiation of synthetic\nand real data, statistical likeness, and privacy.\n\nApplication\n\nRather than apply metrics on an ad-hoc basis, some SDV power users were creating\nmini-workflows to rapidly test out different models, datasets and evaluation\ncriteria in succession. Inspired by their innovation, we created SDGym\n[https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDGym], a system that allows users to input models,\ndatasets and success metrics to build a comprehensive evaluation framework.\n\nThe SDV Software Today\nThe SDV software is continuously evolving based on community feedback. In this\narticle, we discussed improvements to the workflow surrounding synthetic data\ngeneration, including data transformations, sampling methods and evaluation\ntools. Earlier, in Part 1 [https://sdv.dev/blog/community-feedback-models] of\nthis series, we discussed the core synthetic data models themselves. In future\nblog articles, we plan to dig deeper into each of these areas, and to uncover\nnew ones with you.\n\nLike the SDV, this blog is a collaborative effort. Use our Slack\n[https://join.slack.com/t/sdv-space/shared_invite/zt-gdsfcb5w-0QQpFMVoyB2Yd6SRiMplcw] \nto let us know which topics you'd like to hear more about. And as always, use \nGitHub [https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV] to file technical issues with the\nsystem. Working together, we can make SDV the most trusted, transparent and\ncomprehensive platform for synthetic data generation!\n\nFor other inquiries, please contact info@sdv.dev [ info@sdv.dev].","html":"<p>The Synthetic Data Vault (SDV) is a software system that allows users all over the world to input a dataset and generate synthetic data.

The SDV was\nborn out of academic research at MIT — but in 2018, we open-sourced it, so that\npeople all over the world could use it.\n\nSince then, we've been listening carefully to our community's feedback, making\nsure that we address any gaps between theoretical academic research and\npractical use. This multi-part series details recent improvements we've made so\nthat SDV works in the real world. In this article, we focus on the machine\nlearning-based modeling techniques that form the core of the system, while Part\n2 [https://sdv.dev/blog/community-feedback-workflow/] will cover the surrounding\nworkflow.\n\nWhat's in a model?\nAt its core, the SDV is a set of machine learning models designed to understand\nand mimic real world data. Once the SDV creates a particular model, developers\ncan generate synthetic data by sampling it. For synthetic data to be successful,\nthis generative model must be correct — but through discussions with our open\nsource community, we realized that there is no such thing as a single, winning\napproach that works every time. Each dataset and use case is different.\n\n\nOur solution is to provide choices, giving users all the necessary tools to make\nuseful synthetic data for each new case at hand. Let's dive into three popular\nuses of the SDV where such options are available: Tabular models, sequential\ndata and business logic.\n\nMore Options for Tabular Models\nThe earliest version of SDV was based on a classic statistical method: Gaussian\nCopulas [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_(probability_theory)]. This model\nis transparent by definition. It allows us to understand and exert control over\nformulas in the model, notably the distributions of each variable. This can be\nespecially useful for business applications, where data often follows\npredictable distributions. For example, wind speed is known to follow a Weibull\ndistribution [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power], biological measures\nlike height usually follow normal distributions\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution#Occurrence_and_applications] \nand credit default rates often follow exponential distributions\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution].\n\nMeanwhile, advances in the AI space had also produced a robust, alternative\nmodel for those willing to sacrifice transparency: A deep learning technique\ncalled Generative Adversarial Networks\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network] (GANs). GANs\nmodel complex processes that don't follow known formulas. While these models’\ninner workings aren’t easily explained by humans, they produce highly accurate\nresults. We created a GAN, called CTGAN, specifically for synthetic data. This\nblack box model is especially good at figuring out complex correlations between\nvariables in large datasets.\n\nFor a long time, SDV allowed users a choice between our Gaussian Copulas based\nmodel, called GaussianCopula, and CTGAN to model tabular data. While this choice\nprovided some flexibility, our users reported they had a hard time choosing\nbetween such extreme alternatives. We wondered if a middle ground was possible:\nCould we specify distributions while also using GANs to identify complex\ncorrelations?\n\nWe couldn't find any model that fit both of these requirements, so we made our\nown! A key insight was that we could use Gaussian Copulas to understand the data\nand transform it before applying it to a GAN. The result is CopulaGAN\n[https://sdv.dev/SDV/user_guides/single_table/copulagan.html], a hybrid model we\nreleased in October 2020.\n\nCopulaGAN is in the middle of the spectrum, between simple, easily understood\nmodels (like GaussianCopula) and complex black box models (like CTGAN).CopulaGAN\ncombines the human accessibility of Gaussian Copulas with the robust accuracy of\nGANs. This innovation provides users with a new choice: a hybrid approach.\n\nThe Special Case of Sequential Data\nAnother tricky case pointed out by our users involved sequential data. While\nsequential data is stored in a table, it is unlike a regular table in that its\nrows are linked together, usually by a time component. This use case is\nextremely frequent, especially in finance — any table with credit card\ntransactions, stock prices, or payments is almost certainly sequential. \n\nAt the time, solutions treated sequential data as a case of general tabular\nmodeling. After all, sequential data is inside a table. However, these solutions\nfailed to incorporate the key information that makes sequential data unique: The\nrelationships that exist between rows.\n\nIn this table of stock prices, rows that describe the same company — in this\ncase, Google — are related to each other through time. Related rows are a\nspecial feature of sequential datasets.While considering this pain point, we\nrecognized sequential data as an entirely new case that required its own unique\nset of modeling techniques. In October 2020, we released our DeepEcho library,\nwhich focuses entirely on sequential data. We also introduced our PAR model:\n[https://sdv.dev/SDV/user_guides/timeseries/par.html] a GAN approach made\nspecifically for sequential data.\n\nEncoding Business Logic using Constraints\nEven with a plethora of modeling choices, it's vital to capture nuances in\nbusiness logic while modeling synthetic data. This is due to differences in how\nhumans and machines understand datasets.\n\nOften, humans can easily glean the meaning of a dataset using context clues.\nConsider a table showing the names and ages of students and their legal\nguardians. A human will intuitively realize that a student must be younger than\ntheir guardian.\n\nIn this table of students and their guardians, the student is always younger\nthan their guardian. This is a constraint that humans intuitively understand.But\nwill a machine understand the same rule? Because all of the SDV's models use\nstatistics, they analyze trends generally — meaning that in this case, they will\ninclude a small possibility that a student could be older than their guardian.\nAfter all, is it totally out of the question that an older individual could\nenroll and list their child as their guardian? Either way, only a human expert\ncan truly figure out what makes sense for this dataset!\n\nTo solve this pain point, SDV introduced the concept of constraints\n[https://sdv.dev/SDV/user_guides/single_table/constraints.html] in July 2020.\nConstraints give users the ability to encode their business knowledge and\nexpertise into an SDV model. In our example, they could specify that a\nguardian's age must be greater than the student's. Currently, the GreaterThan\nand UniqueCombination constraints allow for easy handling of common scenarios.\nWe also provide a blanket CustomConstraint class, which gives users flexibility\nto capture more nuanced knowledge.\n\nMore Community Feedback\nWe believe that the more humans and machines can work together, the more\nefficient our processes can become. In this article, we explained how user\nfeedback about the SDV led to new core modeling techniques and innovations —\nenabling a system that now provides a choice of multiple models, handles\nsequential data, and understands constraints. In Part 2\n[https://sdv.dev/blog/community-feedback-workflow/], we will discuss similar\nfeedback-driven innovations in the rest of the workflow.\n\nUsing SDV — and giving us feedback — fuels this rapid evolution. To start a\ndiscussion, please message us on Slack\n[https://join.slack.com/t/sdv-space/shared_invite/zt-gdsfcb5w-0QQpFMVoyB2Yd6SRiMplcw] \nor file an issue on GitHub [https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV].

We, the creators of MIT's Synthetic Data Vault, warmly welcome you\nto our official blog. Soon we'll be using this space to deep-dive into topics\nrelated to our libraries, and to unpack ideas in the synthetic data space. We're\nlooking forward to exploring this exciting area with you.\n\nBut first, we want to properly introduce our project: The Synthetic Data Vault\n[https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV] (SDV), an open source software ecosystem for\ngenerating synthetic data. In this post, we’ll explain why synthetic data is\nimportant, and tell the story of how we created the vault. We’ll also lay out\nwhat’s in store — and how you can get involved. Let’s get started with a brief\noverview.\n\nSynthetic Data What?\nSynthetic data is a bold new frontier in machine learning. It allows developers\nto share and use data more effectively.\n\nIt may seem counterintuitive, but although billions of gigabytes of data are\nproduced every day, there are still huge gaps in what developers are actually\nable to use. Accessibility concerns, regulatory issues and imbalanced datasets\ncan all keep experts from using data. This impedes progress in finance, health\ncare and other domains.\n\nGood synthetic data can fill these gaps. The SDV uses machine learning to\nanalyze data. Then, it creates fully synthetic datasets that mimic the original.\nAlthough the synthetic data is entirely machine generated, it maintains the\noriginal format and mathematical properties. This makes synthetic data\nversatile. It can completely replace the existing data in a workflow, or it can\nsupplement the data to enhance its utility. Already, our users have successfully\nused the SDV to augment datasets, test applications, remove bias and more.\n\nA History of the SDV\nOur story starts in 2013. In MIT's Laboratory for Information and Decision\nSystems (LIDS), we were working on general data science projects. We had\ndeveloped new techniques, and we were excited to test them on real datasets.\nHowever, as soon as we asked for the data, we hit roadblocks. The process for\ngetting access to data turned out to be much more complex than we anticipated,\nwith many regulations and security red tape. \n\nWe wondered: What if we didn't need the real data in the first place? If we had\nsynthetic data with the same mathematical properties as the original, it would\nbe much easier for everyone to share and use.\n\nIn 2016, we released a paper describing the very first iteration of the SDV\n[https://dai.lids.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SDV.pdf]. It introduced a\nnovel technique for synthesizing multi-table data, and included trials where\ndata scientists successfully used synthetic data instead of real data for\nmachine learning tasks. Related research to come out of the lab included CTGAN\n[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.00503.pdf], a novel approach to generating synthetic\ndata using deep learning.\n\nAfter these successes in the research community, we decided to move beyond\npurely academic solutions. Synthetic data has the potential to solve real-world\nproblems faced by people on all sides of data science: internal developers\nwriting software, external contractors working offshore, 3rd party partners\noffering services and even the end users who create the data. After some pilot\ntesting on enterprise applications, we open sourced our work in 2018, publishing \nsdv on PyPi [https://pypi.org/project/sdv/] for general use. Open sourcing\noffered ample opportunities for collaboration and customization. It allowed\nusers all over the world to test the SDV in enterprise settings, and helped the\nSDV ecosystem evolve into a one-stop shop for synthetic data needs!\n\nUsers all over the world are using our software to create synthetic data. This\nmap shows the total downloads* of CTGAN [https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN] (our\nmost popular synthetic data model) per continent.We listened to feedback and, as\nof today, have made 93 releases (across all our libraries), addressing 504\nissues. We have been thrilled to see a burgeoning community of invested users\nusing the SDV to solve problems. We've seen over 200K user downloads from PyPi,\n400 stars in the SDV GitHub repository [https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV] and 200\ndevelopers in our Slack channel. Our community is global and includes people in\ndiverse roles: academics, data scientists, operations managers, engineers and\nmore. We are continually learning from our community, and we're excited to bring\nnew innovations to you!\n\nJust the Beginning\nSynthetic data has the potential to revolutionize the entire field of data\nscience, allowing us to solve problems that once seemed untouchable. We want the\nSynthetic Data Vault to be the most trusted, transparent and comprehensive\nplatform for synthetic data generation, but we can't do it without our users.\nIt's our ever-growing open source community that allows us to quickly repair\nbugs, triage feature requests and improve to serve a variety of real-world\nneeds.\n\nThat’s where you come in. If you’re already a member of this community, we can’t\nthank you enough. And if you’d like to get involved, see below for ways to get\nstarted. Either way, watch this space for more nuanced discussions about\nsynthetic data. We're excited to share what we've learned from you, and show how\nwe are collectively improving the ecosystem.

Already, our users have successfully used the SDV to augment datasets, test applications, remove bias and more.</p><h3 id=\"a-history-of-the-sdv\">A History of the SDV</h3><p>Our story starts in 2013. In MIT's Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS), we were working on general data science projects. We had developed new techniques, and we were excited to test them on real datasets. However, as soon as we asked for the data, we hit roadblocks. The process for getting access to data turned out to be much more complex than we anticipated, with many regulations and security red tape. </p><p>We wondered: What if we didn't need the real data in the first place? If we had synthetic data with the same mathematical properties as the original, it would be much easier for everyone to share and use.</p><p>In 2016, we released a paper describing the very first iteration of the <a href=\"https://dai.lids.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SDV.pdf\">SDV</a>. It introduced a novel technique for synthesizing multi-table data, and included trials where data scientists successfully used synthetic data instead of real data for machine learning tasks. Related research to come out of the lab included <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.00503.pdf\">CTGAN</a>, a novel approach to generating synthetic data using deep learning.</p><p>After these successes in the research community, we decided to move beyond purely academic solutions. Synthetic data has the potential to solve real-world problems faced by people on all sides of data science: internal developers writing software, external contractors working offshore, 3rd party partners offering services and even the end users who create the data. After some pilot testing on enterprise applications, we open sourced our work in 2018, publishing <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/sdv/\">sdv on PyPi</a> for general use. Open sourcing offered ample opportunities for collaboration and customization. It allowed users all over the world to test the SDV in enterprise settings, and helped the SDV ecosystem evolve into a one-stop shop for synthetic data needs!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://sdv.ghost.io/content/images/2021/04/Blog-Map.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"A world map with download statistics from different continents.\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1279\" srcset=\"https://sdv.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/04/Blog-Map.png 600w, https://sdv.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/04/Blog-Map.png 1000w, https://sdv.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2021/04/Blog-Map.png 1600w, https://sdv.ghost.io/content/images/size/w2400/2021/04/Blog-Map.png 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>Users all over the world are using our software to create synthetic data.
