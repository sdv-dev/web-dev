The SDV was\nborn out of academic research at MIT — but in 2018, we open-sourced it, so that\npeople all over the world could use it.\n\nSince then, we've been listening carefully to our community's feedback, making\nsure that we address any gaps between theoretical academic research and\npractical use. This multi-part series details recent improvements we've made so\nthat SDV works in the real world. In this article, we focus on the machine\nlearning-based modeling techniques that form the core of the system, while Part\n2 [https://sdv.dev/blog/community-feedback-workflow/] will cover the surrounding\nworkflow.\n\nWhat's in a model?\nAt its core, the SDV is a set of machine learning models designed to understand\nand mimic real world data. Once the SDV creates a particular model, developers\ncan generate synthetic data by sampling it. For synthetic data to be successful,\nthis generative model must be correct — but through discussions with our open\nsource community, we realized that there is no such thing as a single, winning\napproach that works every time. Each dataset and use case is different.\n\n\nOur solution is to provide choices, giving users all the necessary tools to make\nuseful synthetic data for each new case at hand. Let's dive into three popular\nuses of the SDV where such options are available: Tabular models, sequential\ndata and business logic.\n\nMore Options for Tabular Models\nThe earliest version of SDV was based on a classic statistical method: Gaussian\nCopulas [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_(probability_theory)]. This model\nis transparent by definition. It allows us to understand and exert control over\nformulas in the model, notably the distributions of each variable. This can be\nespecially useful for business applications, where data often follows\npredictable distributions. For example, wind speed is known to follow a Weibull\ndistribution [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power], biological measures\nlike height usually follow normal distributions\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution#Occurrence_and_applications] \nand credit default rates often follow exponential distributions\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution].\n\nMeanwhile, advances in the AI space had also produced a robust, alternative\nmodel for those willing to sacrifice transparency: A deep learning technique\ncalled Generative Adversarial Networks\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network] (GANs). GANs\nmodel complex processes that don't follow known formulas. While these models’\ninner workings aren’t easily explained by humans, they produce highly accurate\nresults. We created a GAN, called CTGAN, specifically for synthetic data. This\nblack box model is especially good at figuring out complex correlations between\nvariables in large datasets.\n\nFor a long time, SDV allowed users a choice between our Gaussian Copulas based\nmodel, called GaussianCopula, and CTGAN to model tabular data. While this choice\nprovided some flexibility, our users reported they had a hard time choosing\nbetween such extreme alternatives. We wondered if a middle ground was possible:\nCould we specify distributions while also using GANs to identify complex\ncorrelations?\n\nWe couldn't find any model that fit both of these requirements, so we made our\nown! A key insight was that we could use Gaussian Copulas to understand the data\nand transform it before applying it to a GAN. The result is CopulaGAN\n[https://sdv.dev/SDV/user_guides/single_table/copulagan.html], a hybrid model we\nreleased in October 2020.\n\nCopulaGAN is in the middle of the spectrum, between simple, easily understood\nmodels (like GaussianCopula) and complex black box models (like CTGAN).CopulaGAN\ncombines the human accessibility of Gaussian Copulas with the robust accuracy of\nGANs. This innovation provides users with a new choice: a hybrid approach.\n\nThe Special Case of Sequential Data\nAnother tricky case pointed out by our users involved sequential data. While\nsequential data is stored in a table, it is unlike a regular table in that its\nrows are linked together, usually by a time component. This use case is\nextremely frequent, especially in finance — any table with credit card\ntransactions, stock prices, or payments is almost certainly sequential. \n\nAt the time, solutions treated sequential data as a case of general tabular\nmodeling. After all, sequential data is inside a table. However, these solutions\nfailed to incorporate the key information that makes sequential data unique: The\nrelationships that exist between rows.\n\nIn this table of stock prices, rows that describe the same company — in this\ncase, Google — are related to each other through time. Related rows are a\nspecial feature of sequential datasets.While considering this pain point, we\nrecognized sequential data as an entirely new case that required its own unique\nset of modeling techniques. In October 2020, we released our DeepEcho library,\nwhich focuses entirely on sequential data. We also introduced our PAR model:\n[https://sdv.dev/SDV/user_guides/timeseries/par.html] a GAN approach made\nspecifically for sequential data.\n\nEncoding Business Logic using Constraints\nEven with a plethora of modeling choices, it's vital to capture nuances in\nbusiness logic while modeling synthetic data. This is due to differences in how\nhumans and machines understand datasets.\n\nOften, humans can easily glean the meaning of a dataset using context clues.\nConsider a table showing the names and ages of students and their legal\nguardians. A human will intuitively realize that a student must be younger than\ntheir guardian.\n\nIn this table of students and their guardians, the student is always younger\nthan their guardian. This is a constraint that humans intuitively understand.But\nwill a machine understand the same rule? Because all of the SDV's models use\nstatistics, they analyze trends generally — meaning that in this case, they will\ninclude a small possibility that a student could be older than their guardian.\nAfter all, is it totally out of the question that an older individual could\nenroll and list their child as their guardian? Either way, only a human expert\ncan truly figure out what makes sense for this dataset!\n\nTo solve this pain point, SDV introduced the concept of constraints\n[https://sdv.dev/SDV/user_guides/single_table/constraints.html] in July 2020.\nConstraints give users the ability to encode their business knowledge and\nexpertise into an SDV model. In our example, they could specify that a\nguardian's age must be greater than the student's. Currently, the GreaterThan\nand UniqueCombination constraints allow for easy handling of common scenarios.\nWe also provide a blanket CustomConstraint class, which gives users flexibility\nto capture more nuanced knowledge.\n\nMore Community Feedback\nWe believe that the more humans and machines can work together, the more\nefficient our processes can become. In this article, we explained how user\nfeedback about the SDV led to new core modeling techniques and innovations —\nenabling a system that now provides a choice of multiple models, handles\nsequential data, and understands constraints. In Part 2\n[https://sdv.dev/blog/community-feedback-workflow/], we will discuss similar\nfeedback-driven innovations in the rest of the workflow.\n\nUsing SDV — and giving us feedback — fuels this rapid evolution. To start a\ndiscussion, please message us on Slack\n[https://join.slack.com/t/sdv-space/shared_invite/zt-gdsfcb5w-0QQpFMVoyB2Yd6SRiMplcw] \nor file an issue on GitHub [https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV]. Working together,\nwe can make SDV the most trusted, transparent and comprehensive platform for\nsynthetic data generation!\n\nFor other inquiries, please contact info@sdv.dev.","html":"<p>In our <a href=\"https://sdv.dev/blog/intro-to-sdv/\">last post</a>, we introduced the <a href=\"https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV\">Synthetic Data Vault</a> (SDV) — a software system that allows users to input a dataset and generate synthetic data.
